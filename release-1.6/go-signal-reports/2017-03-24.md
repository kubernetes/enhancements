## Issues
- [Total in 1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av1.6): 9 (**+3 from last report**)
- ["broken test run" issues in 1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fflake+%22broken+test+run%22++milestone%3Av1.6&utf8=%E2%9C%93): 0 (unchanged from last report)

### Action required
- Ensure all issues in milestone are release blocking
- Ensure all issues in milestone have SIG routing label
- Ensure all issues opened by a human have an assignee. It's now possible to [assign people using prow](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-wg-contribex/t6aceRk03Ag); thanks contribx!
- Move all non blocking issues out of `v1.6` milestone **and into** *either* the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones 
- Close "broken test run" issues for transient test infrastructure failures 
- Close issues which have been addressed
- Close issues opened by GCP infrastructure failures on 15 March 2017

#### Action Required
- **Do not open a flake issue without assigning a SIG to that issue**
- **Do not remove a milestone without assigning a new milestone**
- Move all non release blocking issues out of `v1.6` milestone and into _either_ the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones
- Assign owners for each blocking issue from each SIG for all remaining release blocking issues
- Provide status updates within 24hrs for all flakes assigned to your SIG
- Continue to ensure flakes are moved into the correct milestone
  - 1.6 *for blocking issues*
  - 1.6.1 *for important but not blocking issues*
  - 1.7 *for non critical issues to address later*

### Bugs
- [Total in 1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Akind%2Fbug%20milestone%3Av1.6): 0 (unchanged from last report)
- [Without Milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Akind%2Fbug%20no%3Amilestone): 105 (**unchanged from last report**)

#### Action Required
- Bug assignees please label all bugs with the appropriate SIG(s)
- **Bug assignees please move all non release blocking bugs out of the `v1.6` milestone** and into the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones
- Bug assignees please provide regular status updates for all bugs with fix or triage in progress
- Bug assignees and SIGs please close fixed bugs
- As spare time allows *please* help to begin addressing bugs without a milestone. Some of these bugs can probably be closed but we should be kind to the community and address these issues.

## Test Failures
- [k8s.io] Cluster level logging using GCL should check that logs from containers are ingested in GCL
- [k8s.io] Rescheduler [Serial] should ensure that critical pod is scheduled in case there is no resources available
- [k8s.io] [Feature:Example] [k8s.io] Cassandra should create and scale cassandra
- [k8s.io] [Feature:Example] [k8s.io] CassandraStatefulSet should create statefulset
- [k8s.io] [Feature:Example] [k8s.io] Hazelcast should create and scale hazelcast
- [k8s.io] Kubelet [Serial] [Slow] [k8s.io] regular resource usage tracking resource tracking for 100 pods per node
- [k8s.io] Services should be able to change the type and ports of a service [Slow]
- [k8s.io] Services should only allow access from service loadbalancer source ranges [Slow]
- [k8s.io] Kubectl client [k8s.io] Kubectl describe should check if kubectl describe prints relevant information for rc and pods [Conformance]
- [k8s.io] Kubectl client [k8s.io] Kubectl run job should create a job from an image when restart is OnFailure [Conformance]
- [k8s.io] Kubectl client [k8s.io] Simple pod should support inline execution and attach
- [k8s.io] StatefulSet [k8s.io] Basic StatefulSet functionality should handle healthy pet restarts during scale
- [k8s.io] SchedulerPredicates [Serial] validates that taints-tolerations is respected if not matching
- [k8s.io] SchedulerPredicates [Serial] validates that InterPodAntiAffinity is respected if matching 2
- [k8s.io] SchedulerPredicates [Serial] validates that NodeAffinity is respected if not matching
- [k8s.io] SchedulerPredicates [Serial] validates that a pod with an invalid NodeAffinity is rejected
- [k8s.io] SchedulerPredicates [Serial] validates that a pod with an invalid podAffinity is rejected because of the LabelSelectorRequirement is invalid
- [k8s.io] SchedulerPredicates [Serial] validates that embedding the JSON PodAffinity and PodAntiAffinity setting as a string in the annotation value work
- [k8s.io] V1Job should fail a job [Slow]
- [k8s.io] Daemon set [Serial] should run and stop complex daemon with node affinity
- [k8s.io] Deployment overlapping deployment should not fight with each other

### Action Required
- Please remove Cassandra and Hazelcast example tests which seem to be misconfigured
- Use the new [triage tool](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-gubernator/triage/index.html?test=Simple%20pod%20should%20handle%20in-cluster%20config%7CNginx%20should%20conform%20to%20Ingress%20spec%7CPreStop%20should%20call%20prestop%20when%20killing%20a%20pod), thanks SIG Testing and Team/Test-Infra!
