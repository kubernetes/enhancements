## Issues
- [Total in milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av1.6): 617

### Action required
- Ensure all issues in milestone are release blocking
- Ensure all issues in milestone have SIG routing label
- Ensure all issues opened by a human have an assignee. It's now possible to [assign people using prow](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-wg-contribex/t6aceRk03Ag); thanks contribx! 
- Move all non blocking issues into the 1.6.1 or 1.7 milestones **do not remove the milestone of the issue**
- Close issues which have been addressed

#### Action Required
- Help route all flakes into SIGs
- **Do not open a flake issue without assigning a SIG to that issue**
- Move all non release blocking issues into the 1.6.1 or 1.7 milestones by 2017-03-10
- Assign owners for each blocking issue from each SIG for all remaining release blocking issues
- Provide status updates within 24hrs for all flakes assigned to your SIG

### Bugs
- [Total in milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Akind%2Fbug%20milestone%3Av1.6): 144 (**+127 from last report due to moving all issues of `kind/bug` into the 1.6 milestone**)

#### Action Required
- Bug assignees please label all bugs with the appropriate SIG(s)
- BUg assignees please move all non release blocking bugs into either the 1.6.1 or 1.7 milestones **do not simply remove the milestone**
