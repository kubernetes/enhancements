## Issues
- [Total in 1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av1.6): 8 (-8 from last report)
- ["broken test run" issues in 1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fflake+%22broken+test+run%22++milestone%3Av1.6&utf8=%E2%9C%93): 0 (-2 from last report)

### Action required
- Ensure all issues in milestone are release blocking
- Ensure all issues in milestone have SIG routing label
- Ensure all issues opened by a human have an assignee. It's now possible to [assign people using prow](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-wg-contribex/t6aceRk03Ag); thanks contribx!
- Move all non blocking issues out of `v1.6` milestone **and into** *either* the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones 
- Close "broken test run" issues for transient test infrastructure failures 
- Close issues which have been addressed
- Close issues opened by GCP infrastructure failures on 15 March 2017

#### Action Required
- **Do not open a flake issue without assigning a SIG to that issue**
- **Do not remove a milestone without assigning a new milestone**
- Move all non release blocking issues out of `v1.6` milestone and into _either_ the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones
- Assign owners for each blocking issue from each SIG for all remaining release blocking issues
- Provide status updates within 24hrs for all flakes assigned to your SIG
- Continue to ensure flakes are moved into the correct milestone
  - 1.6 *for blocking issues*
  - 1.6.1 *for important but not blocking issues*
  - 1.7 *for non critical issues to address later*

### Bugs
- [Total in 1.6 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Akind%2Fbug%20milestone%3Av1.6): 2 (-3 from last report)
- [Without Milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Akind%2Fbug%20no%3Amilestone): 104 (-1 from last report)

#### Action Required
- Bug assignees please label all bugs with the appropriate SIG(s)
- **Bug assignees please move all non release blocking bugs out of the `v1.6` milestone** and into the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones
- Bug assignees please provide regular status updates for all bugs with fix or triage in progress
- Bug assignees and SIGs please close fixed bugs
- As spare time allows *please* help to begin addressing bugs without a milestone. Some of these bugs can probably be closed but we should be kind to the community and address these issues.

## Test Failures
- [k8s.io] [Feature:Example] [k8s.io] Cassandra should create and scale cassandra
- [k8s.io] [Feature:Example] [k8s.io] CassandraStatefulSet should create statefulset
- [k8s.io] [Feature:Example] [k8s.io] Hazelcast should create and scale hazelcast
- [k8s.io] Loadbalancing: L7 [k8s.io] GCE [Slow] [Feature:Ingress] should conform to Ingress spec
- [k8s.io] Cluster level logging using GCL should check that logs from containers are ingested in GCL
- [k8s.io] Kubelet [Serial] [Slow] [k8s.io] regular resource usage tracking resource tracking for 100 pods per node
- [k8s.io] Services should be able to change the type and ports of a service [Slow]
- [k8s.io] Services should only allow access from service loadbalancer source ranges [Slow]

### Action Required
- Please remove Cassandra and Hazelcast example tests which seem to be misconfigured

### Action Required
- Address all suite failures *immediately*
- Pay particular attention to skew test failures
- Use the new [triage tool](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-gubernator/triage/index.html?test=Simple%20pod%20should%20handle%20in-cluster%20config%7CNginx%20should%20conform%20to%20Ingress%20spec%7CPreStop%20should%20call%20prestop%20when%20killing%20a%20pod), thanks SIG Testing and Team/Test-Infra!

## Incomplete Features

- PRs still needing docs
  - https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/43
- Human curated release notes still incomplete. Specifically very litte curation of [automatically generated release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/blob/release-notes-draft-1.6/release-1.6/release-notes-draft.md#auto-generated-release-notes)

### Action Required
- Feature owners fill out feature template by **TODAY!**
- Feature owners submit docs PR which references issue in features repo by **TODAY!**
- Feature owners prepare release notes by **TODAY!**
- Address etcd upgrade test failures
- Finish adding human curated release notes to [the release notes draft](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/blob/release-notes-draft-1.6/release-1.6/release-notes-draft.md) by **TODAY** **please commit directly to the `release-notes-draft-1.6` branch so we can comment on the [associated PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/pull/203) collectively**
