## Issues
- [Total in milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20milestone%3Av1.6): 100 (-72 from last report)
- ["broken test run" issues in 1.5 milestone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Fflake+%22broken+test+run%22++milestone%3Av1.6&utf8=%E2%9C%93): 19 (-5 from last report)

### Action required
- Ensure all issues in milestone are release blocking
- Ensure all issues in milestone have SIG routing label
- Ensure all issues opened by a human have an assignee. It's now possible to [assign people using prow](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-wg-contribex/t6aceRk03Ag); thanks contribx!
- Move all non blocking issues out of `v1.6` milestone **and into** *either* the `v1.6.1` or `v1.7` milestones 
- Close "broken test run" issues for transient test infrastructure failures 
- Close issues which have been addressed
