## Summary

Reclaim policy associated with the Persistent Volume is currently ignored under certain circumstance. For a `Bound`
PV-PVC pair the ordering of PV-PVC deletion determines whether the PV delete reclaim policy is honored. The PV honors
the reclaim policy if the PVC is deleted prior to deleting the PV, however, if the PV is deleted prior to deleting the
PVC then the Reclaim policy is not exercised. As a result of this behavior, the associated storage asset in the
external infrastructure is not removed.

## Motivation

Prevent volumes from being leaked by honoring the PV Reclaim policy after the `Bound` PVC is also deleted.

### Goals

- Ensure no volumes are leaked when the PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC if the PV Reclaim policy is set to `Delete`.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

## Proposal

To better understand the existing issue we will initially walk through existing behavior when a Bound PV is deleted prior to deleting the PVC.

```
kubectl delete pv <pv-name>
```

On deleting a `Bound` PV, a `deletionTimestamp` is added on to the PV object, this triggers an update which is consumed by the PV-PVC-controller. The PV-PVC-controller observes that the PV is still associated with a PVC, and the PVC hasn't been deleted, as a result of this, the PV-PVC-controller attempts to update the PV phase to `Bound` state. Assuming that the PV was already bound previously, this update eventually amounts to a no-op.

The PVC is deleted at a later point of time.

```
kubectl -n <namespace> delete pvc <pvc-name>
```

1. A `deletionTimestamp` is added on the PVC object.
2. The PVC-protection-controller picks the update, verifies if `deletionTimestamp` is present and there are no pods that are currently using the PVC.
3. If there are no Pods using the PVC, the PVC finalizers are removed, eventually triggering a PVC delete event.
4. The PV-PVC-controller processes delete PVC event, leading to removal of the PVC from it's in-memory cache followed by triggering an explicit sync on the PV.
5. The PV-PVC-controller processes the triggered explicit sync, here, it observes that the PVC is no longer available and updates the PV phase to `Released` state.
6. If the PV-protection-controller picks the update, it observes that there is a `deletionTimestamp` and the PV is not in a `Bound` phase, this causes the finalizers to be removed.
7. This is followed by PV-PVC-controller initiating the reclaim volume workflows.
8. The reclaim volume workflow observes the `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` as `Delete` and schedules a volume deletion.
9. Under the event that (6) has occurred and when `deleteVolumeOperation` executes it attempts to retrieve the latest PV state from the API server, however, due to (6) the PV is removed from the API server, leading to an error state. This results in the plugin volume deletion not being exercised hence leaking the volume.
    ```go
    func (ctrl *PersistentVolumeController) deleteVolumeOperation(volume *v1.PersistentVolume) (string, error) {
      klog.V(4).Infof("deleteVolumeOperation [%s] started", volume.Name)

      // This method may have been waiting for a volume lock for some time.
      // Previous deleteVolumeOperation might just have saved an updated version, so
      // read current volume state now.
      newVolume, err := ctrl.kubeClient.CoreV1().PersistentVolumes().Get(context.TODO(), volume.Name, metav1.GetOptions{}) //<========== NotFound error thrown
      if err != nil {
        klog.V(3).Infof("error reading persistent volume %q: %v", volume.Name, err)
        return "", nil
      }
        // Remaining code below skipped for brevity...
        // Please refer pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go in kubernetes/kubernetes for the full code. 
    ```
10. Under the event that (6) has not occurred yet, during execution of  `deleteVolumeOperation` it is observed that the PV has a pre-existing `deletionTimestamp`, this makes the method assume that delete is already being processed. This results in the plugin volume deletion not being exercised hence leaking the volume.
    ```go
    func (ctrl *PersistentVolumeController) deleteVolumeOperation(volume *v1.PersistentVolume) (string, error) {
      klog.V(4).Infof("deleteVolumeOperation [%s] started", volume.Name)

      // This method may have been waiting for a volume lock for some time.
      // Previous deleteVolumeOperation might just have saved an updated version, so
      // read current volume state now.
      newVolume, err := ctrl.kubeClient.CoreV1().PersistentVolumes().Get(context.TODO(), volume.Name, metav1.GetOptions{})
      if err != nil {
        klog.V(3).Infof("error reading persistent volume %q: %v", volume.Name, err)
        return "", nil
      }

      if newVolume.GetDeletionTimestamp() != nil {//<==========================DeletionTimestamp set since the PV was deleted first.
        klog.V(3).Infof("Volume %q is already being deleted", volume.Name)
        return "", nil
      }
        // Remaining code below skipped for brevity...
        // Please refer pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go in kubernetes/kubernetes for the full code.
    ```
11.  Meanwhile, the external-provisioner checks if there is a `deletionTimestamp` on the PV, if so, it assumes that its in a transitory state and returns false for the `shouldDelete` check.
    ```go
    // shouldDelete returns whether a volume should have its backing volume
    // deleted, i.e. whether a Delete is "desired"
    func (ctrl *ProvisionController) shouldDelete(ctx context.Context, volume *v1.PersistentVolume) bool {
      if deletionGuard, ok := ctrl.provisioner.(DeletionGuard); ok {
        if !deletionGuard.ShouldDelete(ctx, volume) {
          return false
        }
      }

      if ctrl.addFinalizer && !ctrl.checkFinalizer(volume, finalizerPV) && volume.ObjectMeta.DeletionTimestamp != nil {
        return false
      } else if volume.ObjectMeta.DeletionTimestamp != nil { //<========== DeletionTimestamp is set on the PV since it's deleted first.
        return false
      }
        // Remaining code below skipped for brevity...
        // Please refer sig-storage-lib-external-provisioner/controller/controller.go for the full code.
    ```

The fix applies to both csi driver volumes and in-tree plugin volumes each either statically or dynamically provisioned.

The main approach in fixing the issue for csi driver volumes involves using an existing finalizer already implemented in sig-storage-lib-external-provisioner. It is `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` which is added on the Persistent Volume. Currently, it is applied only during provisioning if the feature is enabled. The proposal is to not only add this finalizer to newly provisioned PVs, but also to extend the library to add the finalizer to existing PVs. Adding the finalizer prevents the PV from being removed from the API server. The finalizer will be removed only after the physical volume on the storage system is deleted.

The main approach in fixing the issue for in-tree volumes involves introducing a new finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller`. The new finalizer will be added on the Persistent Volume when it is created. The finalizer will be removed only after the plugin reports a successful delete. If the in-tree volume is migrated then any existing finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` will be removed. If the migration is turned off, the finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` will be added back to the Persistent Volume.

When the PVC is deleted, the PV is moved into `Released` state and following checks are made:

1. In-Tree Volumes:
`DeletionTimestamp` checks can be ignored, instead volume being in a `Released` state is sufficient criteria. The existing `DeletionTimestamp` check incorrectly assumes that the PV cannot be deleted prior to deleting the PVC. On deleting a PV, a `DeletionTimestamp` is set on the PV, when the PVC is deleted, an explicit sync on the PV is triggered, the existing `DeletionTimestamp` check assumes that the volume is already under deletion and skips calling the plugin to delete the volume from underlying storage.

2. CSI driver

If when processing the PV update it is observed that it has `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` finalizer and `DeletionTimestamp` set, then the volume deletion request is forwarded to the driver, provided other pre-defined conditions are met.

When a PV with `Delete` reclaim policy is not associated with a PVC:

Under the event that the PV is not associated with a PVC, either finalizers `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` or `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` are not added to the PV. If such a PV is deleted the reclaim workflow is not executed, this is the current behavior and will be retained.

### Risks and Mitigations

The primary risk is volume deletion to a user that expect the current behavior, i.e, they do not expect the volume to be deleted from the underlying storage infrastructure when for a bound PV-PVC pair, the PV is deleted followed by deleting the PVC. This can be mitigated by initially introducing the fix behind a feature gate, followed by explicitly deprecating the current behavior.

## Design Details

A feature gate named `HonorPVReclaimPolicy` will be introduced for both `kube-controller-manager` and `external-provisioner`.

### CSI Driver volumes

An existing finalizer `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` is already implemented in sig-storage-lib-external-provisioner. It is added on the Persistent Volume. Currently, it is applied only during provisioning if the feature is enabled. The proposal is to not only add this finalizer to newly provisioned PVs, but also to extend the library to add the finalizer to existing PVs. The existing `AddFinalizer` config option will be used to apply the finalizer. Adding the finalizer prevents the PV from being removed from the API server. The finalizer will be removed only after the physical volume on the storage system is deleted.

When CSI Migration is enabled, external-provisioner adds `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` to all the PVs it creates, including in-tree ones. When CSI Migration is disabled, however, these PVs will be deleted by in-tree volume plugin. Therefore, in-tree PV controller needs to be modified to remove the finalizer when the PV is being deleted when CSI Migration is disabled.

```go
// PVDeletionProtectionFinalizer finalizer is added to the PV to prevent PV from being deleted before the physical volume
PVDeletionProtectionFinalizer = "external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer"
```

On the CSI driver side, the library adds the finalizer only to newly provisioned PVs. The proposal is to extend the library to (optionally) add the finalizer to all PVs (that are handled by the external-provisioner), to have all PVs protected once the feature is enabled.

When the `shouldDelete` checks succeed, a delete volume request is initiated on the driver. This ensures that the volume is deleted on the backend.

Once the volume is deleted from the backend, the finalizer can be removed. This allows the pv to be removed from the api server.

Note: This feature should work with CSI Migration disabled or enabled.

Statically provisioned volumes would behave the same as dynamically provisioned volumes except in cases where the PV is not associated with a PVC, in such cases finalizer `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` is not added.

If at any point a statically provisioned PV is `Bound` to a PVC, then the finalizer `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` gets added by the external-provisioner.

### In-Tree Plugin volumes

A new finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` will be introduced. The finalizer will be added to newly created in-tree volumes as well as existing in-tree volumes. The finalizer will only be removed after the plugin successfully deletes the in-tree volume.

When CSI Migration is enabled, the finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` will be removed from the in-tree volume PV, and as stated previously, the external-provisioner adds `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` finalizer on to the PV. However, when CSI Migration is disabled, the finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` is added back on the PV.

```go
// PVDeletionInTreeProtectionFinalizer is the finalizer added to protect PV deletion for in-tree volumes.
PVDeletionInTreeProtectionFinalizer = "kubernetes.io/pv-controller"

// Please refer pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/util/util.go for the full code.
```

In `deleteVolumeOperation` in kubernetes/pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go, checks for `DeletionTimestamp` should be ignored, the check currently prevents the volume from being deleted by the underlying storage by the plugin. In cases where the PV is deleted first, the `DeletionTimestamp` is expected to be set on the PV.

The PV could be removed from the API server if the in-tree pv-controller removed the `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` finalizer, and the external-provisioner hasn't added `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` finalizer.

```go
// deleteVolumeOperation deletes a volume. This method is running in standalone
// goroutine and already has all necessary locks.
func (ctrl *PersistentVolumeController) deleteVolumeOperation(volume *v1.PersistentVolume) (string, error) {
	klog.V(4).Infof("deleteVolumeOperation [%s] started", volume.Name)
	newVolume, err := ctrl.kubeClient.CoreV1().PersistentVolumes().Get(context.TODO(), volume.Name, metav1.GetOptions{})
	if err != nil {
		klog.V(3).Infof("error reading persistent volume %q: %v", volume.Name, err)
		return "", nil
	}
    
	// Ignore the DeletionTimeStamp checks if the feature is enabled.
	if !utilfeature.DefaultFeatureGate.Enabled(features.HonorPVReclaimPolicy) {
		if newVolume.GetDeletionTimestamp() != nil {
			klog.V(3).Infof("Volume %q is already being deleted", volume.Name)
			return "", nil
		}
	}
	//.....
	//.....
	//.....
	klog.V(4).Infof("deleteVolumeOperation [%s]: success", volume.Name)
        return pluginName, err
    }
// Remaining code below skipped for brevity...
// Please refer pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go in kubernetes/kubernetes for the full code.
```

The pv-controller is expected to add the finalizer when the claim is provisioned and PV is created, and the finalizer is to be removed when the plugin confirms a successful volume deletion.

The pv-controller is also expected to add the finalizer to all existing in-tree plugin volumes.

The pv-controller would also be responsible to add or remove the finalizer based on CSI Migration being disabled or enabled respectively.

The finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` will not be added on statically provisioned in-tree volumes.

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

- `pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume`: [`2025-02-05` - `80.4%`](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit&include-filter-by-regex=pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume)

##### Integration tests

No integration tests are required. This feature is better tested with e2e tests.

##### e2e tests

An e2e test to exercise deletion of PV prior to deletion of PVC for a `Bound` PV-PVC pair.

- [test/e2e/storage/csimock/csi_honor_pv_reclaim_policy.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2334b8469e1983c525c0c6382125710093a25883/test/e2e/storage/csimock/csi_honor_pv_reclaim_policy.go): [k8s-triage](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html?sig=scheduling,storage&test=honor%20pv%20reclaim%20policy), [k8s-test-grid](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-storage-kubernetes#kind-storage-alpha-beta-features&include-filter-by-regex=CSI%20Mock%20honor%20pv%20reclaim%20policy)

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feedback
- Fix of the issue behind a feature flag.
- Unit tests and e2e tests outlined in design proposal implemented.
- Tests should be done with both CSI Migration disabled and enabled.

#### Beta

- Allow the Alpha fix to soak for one release.
- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Fully implemented in both kubernetes and CSI driver repositories
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- Deployed in production and have gone through at least one K8s upgrade.
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

* Upgrade from old Kubernetes(1.25) to new Kubernetes(1.26) with `HonorPVReclaimPolicy` flag enabled

In the above scenario, the upgrade will cause change in default behavior as described in the current KEP. Additionally,
if there are PVs that have a valid associated PVC and deletion timestamp set, then a finalizer is added to the PV.

* Downgrade from new Kubernetes(1.26) to old Kubernetes(1.25).

In this case, there may be PVs with the deletion finalizer that the older Kubernetes does not remove. Such PVs will be in the API server forever unless if the user manually removes them.

### Version Skew Strategy

The fix is part of `kube-controller-manager` and `external-provisioner`.

1. `kube-controller-manager` is upgraded, but `external-provisioner` is not:

In this case the drivers would still have the issue since the `external-provisioner` is not updated.

This does not have effect on in-tree plugin volumes, as the upgraded `kube-controller-manager` ensures the protection by adding and removing the newly introduced `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` finalizer.

2. `external-provisioner` is upgraded but `kube-controller-manager` is not:

In this case the finalizer will be added and removed by the external-provisioner, hence, driver volumes will be protected.

PVs backed by the in-tree volume plugin will not be protected and  would still have the issue.

In addition, PVs migrated to CSI will have the finalizer. When the CSI migration is disabled, in-tree volume plugin / controller-manager does not remove the finalizer. The finalizer must be manually removed by the cluster admin.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: `HonorPVReclaimPolicy`
  - Components depending on the feature gate: 
    - kube-controller-manager
    - external-provisioner

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

Enabling the feature will delete the volume from underlying storage when the PV is deleted followed deleting the PVC for a bound PV-PVC pair where the PV reclaim policy is delete.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. Disabling the feature flag will continue previous behavior. However, after the rollback if there are existing PVs that have the finalizer `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` or `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` cannot be deleted from the API server(due to the finalizers), these PVs must be explicitly patched to remove the finalizers.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Will pick the new behavior as described before.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

There will be unit tests for the feature `HonorPVReclaimPolicy` enablement/disablement.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

No.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

Users can compare these existing metrics with the feature gate enabled and disabled and see if downgrade actually helped.

- `persistentvolumeclaim_provision_failed_total`
- `persistentvolume_delete_failed_total`

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

This feature is already beta since 1.30. No upgrade or rollback needed to test this.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

The presence of finalizer described above in Persistent Volume will indicate that the feature is enabled.
The finalizer `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` will be present on the CSI Driver volumes.
The finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` will be present on In-Tree Plugin volumes.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: the `metadata.finalizers` field of a PV object will have the finalizer `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` for CSI Driver volumes and `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` for In-Tree Plugin volumes.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

The current SLOs for `persistentvolume_delete_duration_seconds` and `volume_operation_total_seconds` would be increased by the amount of time taken to remove the newly introduced finalizer. This should be an insignificant increase.

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [x] Metrics
  - Metric name: For CSI Driver volumes, `persistentvolume_delete_duration_seconds` metric is used to track the time taken for PV deletion. `volume_operation_total_seconds` metrics tracks the end-to-end latency for delete operation, it is applicable to both CSI driver volumes and in-tree plugin volumes.
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

No.

### Dependencies

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

Yes, a CSI driver supporting this enhancement is required when a persistent volume is provisioned with the csi source or can be migrated to CSI.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

The new finalizer will be added to all existing PVs when the feature is enabled. This will be a one-time sync.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

Yes, previously the delete volume call would not reach the provider under the described circumstances, with this change the volume delete will be invoked to remove the volume from the underlying storage.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

When the feature is enabled, we will be adding a new finalizer to existing PVs so this would result in an increase of the PV size.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

We have metric for delete volume operations. So potentially the time to delete a PV could be longer now since we want to make sure volume on the storage system is deleted first before deleting the PV.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

No.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

If API server is unavailable, an API update on the PV object will fail due to timeout. Failed operations will be added back to a rate-limited queue for retries. A `DeleteVolume` call to CSI driver is idempotent. So when API server is back, and the same request is sent to the CSI driver again, the CSI driver should return success even if the volume is already deleted from the storage system by the previous request.

###### What are other known failure modes?

- Volume may not be deleted from the underlying storage if the PV is deleted rapidly after the reclaim policy changes to `Delete`.
  - Detection: The only way to detect this is by comparing the PVs in the API server and the volumes in the storage system.
  - Mitigations: If the reclaim policy is `Delete`, please make sure the finalizer is added to the PV before deleting the PV.
  - Diagnostics: external-provisioner should log `error syncing volume: xxx`.
  - Testing: It's hard to test this failure mode. Because there's a race condition between the PV deletion and the finalizer addition.

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

N/A.

## Implementation History

- 1.26: Alpha
- 1.31: Add e2e tests for the feature and promote to Beta.
- 1.33: Promote to GA.

## Drawbacks

None. The current behavior could be considered as a drawback, the KEP presents the fix to the drawback. The current behavior was reported in [Issue-546](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/issues/546) and [Issue-195](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner/issues/195)

## Alternatives

Other approaches to fix have not been considered and will be considered if presented during the KEP review.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

Initially, all development will happen inside the main Kubernetes and CSI driver repositories. The mock driver can be developed inside test/e2e/storage/csimock. For the generic part of that driver, i.e. the code that other drivers can reuse, is developed in the kubernetes-csi organization.
