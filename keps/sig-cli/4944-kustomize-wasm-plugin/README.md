## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md
-->

This KEP proposes adding WebAssembly plugin support as a sandboxed execution
environment for the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) framework in Kustomize.

This enhancement enables platform-independent plugin execution in a secure,
sandboxed environment, eliminating runtime dependencies while maintaining strict
isolation.

And promote kustomize KRM plugins to GA with the addition and stability of Wasm
KRM Function.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

Kustomize currently supports various ways to transform Kubernetes resources,
including built-in transformers and
[container](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/guides/extending_kustomize/containerized_krm_functions/)/[exec](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/guides/extending_kustomize/exec_krm_functions/)
plugins. However, these methods have limitations in terms of portability,
security, and performance.

By introducing Wasm plugin support, we can address these limitations and provide
a more robust solution for custom resource transformations.

#### Limitation current plugins

The current Kustomize plugin ecosystem faces several operational challenges that
limit its effectiveness in various environments. Container plugins, while
providing good isolation, require a container runtime, which is often unavailable
or restricted in CI/CD environments due to security policies or resource
constraints. Exec plugins are tightly coupled to their underlying operating
system and execution environment, requiring platform-specific compilation and
distribution. This makes maintaining consistency across diverse environments
challenging. Additionally, container plugins introduce architecture-specific
dependencies, requiring builds for different CPU architectures (e.g., amd64,
arm64), which complicates deployment across heterogeneous infrastructure. These
limitations create scenarios where neither exec nor container plugins can be
effectively utilized, particularly in organizations with diverse infrastructure
requirements or strict security policies.

### Goals

1. Implement Wasm plugin support in the Kustomize KRM framework
1. Provide a secure sandboxed environment for executing custom transformations
1. Improve portability of custom transformers across different platforms
1. Enhance performance of resource transformations through WebAssembly

### Non-Goals

1. Replace existing transformation methods (built-in transformers and exec
   plugins)
1. Implement specific Wasm plugins (focus is on the framework support)

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

We propose to extend the Kustomize KRM framework to support WASI plugins as an
additional execution environment. This proposal is motivated by several key
factors and aims to provide significant benefits:

#### Benefits of Wasm Plugin Support

##### Platform Independence

WASM allows for writing plugins that are independent of OS and CPU
architecture.This ensures consistent behavior across different environments and
simplifies deployment.

##### Simplified Distribution

WASM plugins can leverage OCI registries for distribution that a potential
alternative to current container plugins. This eliminates the need to separately
distribute executable binaries to the execution environment, as is often
required with exec plugins.

##### Familiar Interface

Previous KRM plugins used stdin for input parameters from kustomize and stdout
for output. The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) naturally supports this
model, allowing for a plugin framework that uses stdin and stdout as interfaces,
maintaining consistency with existing patterns and user migration will be
easier.

##### Enhanced Security

Wasm provides a sandboxed environment, offering improved security compared to
traditional exec plugins.

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

A DevOps engineer needs to build a common CI/CD pipeline that operates across
multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments. By using Wasm plugins,
they can implement custom resource transformations that work consistently and
securely across different execution environments, eliminating the overhead of
distributing and managing binaries for each environment.

#### Story 2

A platform team wants to share team-specific resource transformation logic as
Kustomize plugins. By distributing Wasm plugins through OCI registries, team
members can easily obtain plugins and start using them without worrying about
execution environment setup or binary compatibility.

#### Story 3

An application developer wants to use a popular open-source Kustomize plugin
that implements advanced JSON patching, which is distributed through an OCI
registry. Since the plugin is implemented in WebAssembly and runs in a sandboxed
environment, they can confidently use the third-party plugin without worrying
about security vulnerabilities or system access. The developer can easily fetch
the latest version of the plugin from the OCI registry, verify its integrity,
and run it safely within their build pipeline, knowing that the plugin's
capabilities are limited to the intended resource transformations.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

- Current kustomize plugin system called `Exec/Container KRM functions` is
  using stdin/stdout to communicate between kustomize and the plugin.
  - WASI also supports stdin/stdout, so we will reuse the current interface
    definitions and users can migrate with minimal changes.
- Now,
  [Wasm binary can be distributed with OCI registry](https://tag-runtime.cncf.io/wgs/wasm/deliverables/wasm-oci-artifact/).

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

1. WASI Specific is not yet GA. Any disruptive changes in the future will incur
   user transition costs.
1. The Wasm OCI Artifact specification is a relatively new standard in the OCI
   ecosystem. Maybe not mature enough.
1. Containaized KRM function is alpha feature but that used some user.
   - Provide container to exec conversion tools.

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

Implement with [wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) to WASM runtime
like the
[kube-scheduler-wasm-extension](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-wasm-extension)
project.

### Interface

Using the WASI to plugin interface.

##### with Wasm binary file

```yaml
apiVersion: transformers.example.co/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: example-app
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      wasip1:
        file: ../bin/fnapp.wasm
spec:
  port: 8080
```

##### with OCI registry

```yaml
apiVersion: transformers.example.co/v1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: example-app
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      wasip1:
        image: ghcr.io/koba1t/krm-fn-app:v0.0.3-wasm
spec:
  port: 8080
```

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[ ] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes
necessary to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

##### Integration tests

<!--
Integration tests are contained in k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration.
Integration tests allow control of the configuration parameters used to start the binaries under test.
This is different from e2e tests which do not allow configuration of parameters.
Doing this allows testing non-default options and multiple different and potentially conflicting command line options.
-->

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

- <test>: <link to test coverage>

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

- <test>: <link to test coverage>

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, [feature gate] graduations, or as
something else. The KEP should keep this high-level with a focus on what
signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

N/A

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and nodes?
- How does an n-3 kubelet or kube-proxy without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- How does an n-1 kube-controller-manager or kube-scheduler without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

N/A - client-side only

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning of
    a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

Feature gates are typically disabled by setting the flag to `false` and
restarting the component. No other changes should be necessary to disable the
feature.

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

N/A - client-side only

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

N/A - client-side only

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

N/A - client-side only

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

I plan to deprecate
[Containerized KRM Functions](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/guides/extending_kustomize/containerized_krm_functions/)
due to I believe it was introduced for the reason of redistributing the plugin,
and we can be replaced by OCI redistribution of WASI.

Current `Containerized KRM Functions` is just only call to `docker` command in
`$PATH`, I feel It can be integrated into the `Exec KRM Finctions`.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

N/A - client-side only

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

N/A - client-side only

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

N/A - client-side only

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

No. Use API types already defined in kustomize repo.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

N/A - client-side only

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

N/A - client-side only

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

N/A - client-side only

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

N/A - client-side only

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?

Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

The WASI specification is not yet GA.

I am considering implementing using the `WASI Preview 1` specification, but this
means a transition will be necessary after the WASI specification is GA.

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

It is possible to use existing `KRM Framework` to run a WASI execution
environment such as [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/). However, all users need
to carefully prepare the execution environment.

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

None. This will be implemented within the existing Kustomize repo.
