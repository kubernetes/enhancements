**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

This KEP proposes a
`PodTerminated` condition in pod status to indicate a pod has
reached a state where it's containers have terminated.

## Motivation

Today, there are two phases, `Succeeded` and `Failed`, which are used to indicate that
all containers in the pod have been terminated.  
The kubelet may update the phase of
the pod to `Succeeded` or `Failed` in the [SyncPod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dc3f5ec6ccb9855dfa99f4c1078625df5fdfab6a/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L1723)
and  waits for the corresponding resource dependencies to be cleanup in the [SyncTerminatedPod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dc3f5ec6ccb9855dfa99f4c1078625df5fdfab6a/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L2146)
when all containers of the pod are terminated. In this case it is not safe to remove
[pvc protection](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/120756)
because the phase of the pod already be in the `Succeeded` or `Failed` state 
but the volumes are not unmounted(the umount process is asynchronous with the pod's phase change).

Custom pod controllers/operators can use a dedicated condition `PodTerminated` indicating
a pod has reached a state where it's containers have terminated and corresponding resource dependencies
have been processed, including:
- volumes are unmounted
- secrets are unregistered
- configmaps are unregistered
- cgroups are removed
- userns are released  

Further details of this is covered in a [user-story](#story-1-remove-pvc-protection-when-pod-reaches-a-completed-state) below.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
--> 
- Surface a new pod condition `PodTerminated` to indicate a pod has reached a state where it's containers
have terminated and corresponding resource dependencies have been processed.
- Remove pvc protection when pod reaches a completed state.


### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

##### Story 1: Remove pvc protection when pod reaches a completed state
The PVC can be safely deleted when a job that mounts a PVC reaches a completed state.
```
status:
  conditions:
  ...
  - lastProbeTime: null
    lastTransitionTime: "2024-04-14T15:33:47Z"
    status: "False"
    type: PodTerminated
  - lastProbeTime: null
    lastTransitionTime: "2024-04-14T15:33:46Z"
    status: "True"
    type: PodScheduled
```

Custom pod controllers/operators can use a dedicated condition `PodTerminated` for removing pvc protection.
```go
func (c *Controller) podUsesPVC(logger klog.Logger, pod *v1.Pod, pvc *v1.PersistentVolumeClaim) bool {
	// Check whether pvc is used by pod only if pod is scheduled, because
	// kubelet sees pods after they have been scheduled and it won't allow
	// starting a pod referencing a PVC with a non-nil deletionTimestamp.
	if pod.Spec.NodeName != "" {
		for _, volume := range pod.Spec.Volumes {
			if volume.PersistentVolumeClaim != nil && volume.PersistentVolumeClaim.ClaimName == pvc.Name && !podIsFinished(pod) ||
				!podIsShutDown(pod) && volume.Ephemeral != nil && ephemeral.VolumeClaimName(pod, &volume) == pvc.Name && ephemeral.VolumeIsForPod(pod, pvc) == nil {
				logger.V(2).Info("Pod uses PVC", "pod", klog.KObj(pod), "PVC", klog.KObj(pvc))
				return true
			}
		}
	}
	return false
}
func podIsFinished(pod *v1.Pod) bool {
    _, condition := GetPodCondition(&status, v1.PodTerminated)
	return condition != nil && condition.Status == v1.ConditionTrue
}
```
As shown above, the `podIsFinished` func can use a dedicated condition `PodTerminated` for removing pvc protection.

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

The Kubelet will set a new condition on a pod: `PodTerminated` to
surface that all containers in the pod have been terminated and corresponding resource dependencies have been processed. 
A new
`PodConditionType` corresponding to `PodTerminated` will be added in
`api/core/v1/types.go`. No changes are required in the Pod Status API for this
enhancement.

### Determining status of `Terminated` for a pod

Today, [SyncTerminatedPod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dc3f5ec6ccb9855dfa99f4c1078625df5fdfab6a/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L2146))
in Kubelet is invoked with the `kubecontainer.PodStatus`
(distinct from the `v1.PodStatus` API) associated with a given pod.
- [TerminatePod](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/b722d017a34b300a2284b890448e5a605f21d01e/pkg/kubelet/status/status_manager.go#L428)
in `statusManager` waits for all corresponding resource dependencies process to be finished.
- Kubelet will initially generate the `PodTerminated` condition in `TerminatePod()` and `ReplaceOrAppendPodCondition` 
for current pod before `updateStatusInternal()`
```go
if utilfeature.DefaultFeatureGate.Enabled(features.PodTerminatedCondition) {
	cType := v1.PodTerminated
	condition := v1.PodCondition{
		Type:   v1.PodTerminated,
		Status: v1.ConditionTrue,
	}
    status.Conditions = utilpod.ReplaceOrAppendPodCondition(status.Conditions, condition)
}
m.updateStatusInternal(pod, status, true, true)
```
- `updateLastTransitionTime` for `PodTerminated` in updateStatusInternal
```go
updateLastTransitionTime(&status, &oldStatus, v1.PodTerminated)
```

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes
necessary to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

A review of the existing E2E tests reveal that coverage of the basic, existing
pod conditions (populated by Kubelet) is sparse. While the existing pod
conditions are quite mature.

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit
This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

New unit tests will be mainly scoped to the Kubelet `status` package that a bulk
of the enhancements above will target.

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/status`: `Apr 16, 2024` - `74.9`
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/status/status_manager.go`: `Apr 16, 2024` - `75.5`
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/controller/volume/pvcprotection/pvc_protection_controller.go`: `` - `72.8`

Note above that while the `Kubelet` package overall has low coverage, the
changes in the context of this KEP is scoped to the `TerminatePod`
method which is a tiny portion of the overall `Kubelet` package in the
kubelet_pods.go file.

##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.
For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

N/A. See notes about e2e tests below.

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.
For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
-->

E2E tests will be introduced to cover the user scenarios mentioned above. Tests
will involve launching pods with characteristics mentioned below and
examining the pod status has the new `PodTerminated` condition with
`status` and `reason` fields populated with expected values:

1. A basic pod that run successfully.
2. A basic pod that run failed.
3. A pod with references to a pvc that run successfully.
4. A pod with references to a pvc that run failed.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

#### Alpha

- Kubelet will report pod conditions if the feature flag `PodTerminated` is enabled.
- E2E tests added for pod conditions.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

N/A

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

N/A

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: PodTerminated
  - Components depending on the feature gate: Kubelet

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

Yes, there will be a new condition for all pods.  
In normal cases, the `PodTerminated` condition will be set to true.  

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

Yes, the feature can be disabled once it has been enabled.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

New pods reach complete state will report the new condition.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.
-->

Unit tests (as outlined in the [Unit tests](#unit-tests) section above) will be
used to confirm that the new pod condition introduced is being:
- evaluated and applied by the Kubelet Status manager when the feature is enabled.
- not evaluated nor applied when the feature is disabled.


### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

This flag is only relevant for the Kubelet. Therefore, the new condition will be
reported for pods scheduled on nodes that have the feature enabled.

If a controller or service consumes these pod conditions but the cluster has turned off this feature,
the controller or service will never match on this pod condition as new pods will never set this condition.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

N/A

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

N/A

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

No

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

This question isn't totally relevant for this feature, since this is an
administrator-enabled feature controlled via kubelet flag, not something the
user controls with an API server resource spec.

Checking the Pod conditions on nodes with this feature enabled is the simplest
way to check if the feature is enabled properly on a vanilla k8s cluster.

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason:
- [x] API .status
  - Condition name: PodTerminated reported for pod
  - Other field:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

There are no SLOs for this feature.  We don't expect any changes to the existing SLOs.  

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [x] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: There are no specific SLIs for the Kubelet Status Manager

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

No

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

No.

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

Yes, the new pod condition will result in the Kubelet Status Manager making additional PATCH calls on the pod status fields.

The Kubelet Status Manager already has infrastructure to cache pod status updates (including pod conditions) and issue the PATCH in a batch.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

Slight increase (a few bytes) of the Pod API object due to persistence of the additional condition in the pod status.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

No

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

No.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?
N/A

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

None so far

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

SLOs are not applicable to pod status fields. Overall Kubernetes node level SLOs
may leverage this feature.

## Implementation History

N/A

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
