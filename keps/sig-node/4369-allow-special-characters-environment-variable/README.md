## Summary

Allows all printable ASCII characters except "=" to be set as environment variables, the range of printable ASCII characters is 32-126.

## Motivation

Kubernetes should not restrict which environment variable names can be used, because it has no way of knowing what the application may need, and people can't always choose their own variable names, which may limit the adoption of Kubernetes.

### Goals

* Allows users to set all ASCII characters with serial numbers in the range of 32-126 except "=" as environment variables.

### Non-Goals

## Proposal

* Implements relaxed validation at the top level validation method when validating API create requests, all ASCII characters in the range 32-126 except "=" can be verified.
* Allow users to set `Configmap` keys and secret keys outside the `C_IDENTIFIER` scope as environment variables using EnvFrom
* Document rules for setting environment variables.

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

I am a .NET Core development engineer, .Net Core applications are using ":" when working with application settings loaded from appsettings.json file. When running .net core app in containers typically overwrite this settings by specifying environmental variable.
such as: 
`"Logging": { "IncludeScopes": false, "LogLevel": { "Default": "Warning" } }`    
override like this `-e Logging:LogLevel:Default=Debug`    

### Risks and Mitigations

Relaxed validation can break upgrade and rollback scenarios, but our use of feature gate to control whether it's enabled or not will make it a manageable risk, with the user having the autonomy to choose whether or not to enable it.

## Design Details

- A feature gate name `RelaxedEnvironmentVariableValidation` controlling the loosening of the envvar name validation, initially in alpha state and defaulting to false

- Two sets of validation logic for envvar names:
  
  * Strict validation
    * Strict validation follows the current design, which only allows envvar names passed the regular expression `[-._a-zA-Z][-._a-zA-Z0-9]*`.
  
  - Relaxed validation
    * Relaxed verification allows all ASCII characters in the range 32-126 as envvar name, and its regular expression is `^[ -<>-~]+$`,  matches a string containing ASCII characters from `space` to `<` and from `>` to `~`, ignore `=`, and has a length of at least 1.
  
- Everywhere we validate envvar names in API objects, plumbing a parameter whether we want the strict or relaxed validation
  - At the top level validation method when validating API create requests, use the strict validation if the feature gate is off
  - At the top level validation method when validating API update requests, use the strict validation if the feature gate is off and the old object passes strict envvar name validation

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

Currently coverages:

* pkg/apis/core/validation/validation_test.go: `2023-12-21` - `83.9%`
* pkg/kubelet/kubelet_pods_test.go: `2023-12-21` - `67.2%`
* staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/validation/validation_test.go: `2023-12-21` - `94.8%`

These tests will be added:

* New tests will be added to ensure environment variable fields can be correctly validated `pkg/apis/core/validation/validation_test.go`
* Add a new test that sets special character environment variables for pods in a given namespace `pkg/kubelet/kubelet_pods_test.go`
* A new test will be added to ensure that the environment variable name field is valid `staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/validation/validation_test.go`

##### Integration tests

- N/A

##### e2e tests

* Add a test to `test/e2e/common/node/configmap.go` to test that the special characters in configmap are consumed by the environment variable.
* Add a test to `test/e2e/common/node/secret.go` to test that the special characters in secret are consumed by the environment variable.
* Add a test to `test/e2e/common/node/expansion` to test environment variable can contain special characters.

We have also added presubmit and periodic test jobs in CI for these e2e tests.
Job names:

- `pull-kubernetes-e2e-relaxed-environment-variable-validation`
- `ci-kubernetes-e2e-relaxed-environment-variable-validation`

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Created the feature gate and implement the feature, disabled by default.
- Add unit and e2e tests for the feature.

#### Beta

- Solicit feedback from the Alpha.
- Ensure tests are stable and passing.
- Add monitor for pods that fail due to using enhancements.

#### GA

- Ensure that the time range from Alpha to GA version can cover the version skew of all components.
- Add troubleshooting details on how to deal with incompatible kubelet/CRI implementations based on issues found in beta releases.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

#### Upgrade

Environment variables previously set by the user will not change. To use this enhancement, users need to enable the feature gate

#### Downgrade

After downgrade, environment variables containing special characters will continue to work as expected, but any writes to resources to add or change environment variables must set the environment variable names to only use normal characters.

### Version Skew Strategy

kube-apiserver will need to enable feature gates to use this feature.

If kube-apiserver is not enabled feature gate will use strict validation.

If the feature gate is disabled and the existing object passes strict validation, strict validation on update will be used.


## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: RelaxedEnvironmentVariableValidation
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-apiserver

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

If disable the feature gate, already running workloads will not be affected in any way, 
but cannot create workloads that use special characters as environment variables.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The feature should continue to work just fine.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Yes.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

When the feature gate is disabled, workloads that are already running will not be affected. However, if user update the workloads, they may fail to recreate pods or ReplicaSets due to failing the Apiserver's validation logic, which could cause the workloads to fail.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

N/A

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

N/A

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

  Yes, operators can use the Kubenetes API to achieve this. They need to get all pods in the cluster and check if any pod has set a field other than `[-._a-zA-Z][-._a-zA-Z0-9]*` as an environment variable name. For example, we can find the namespaces and names of pods using this feature and their environment variable names using the following command:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.containers[].env[]?.name | test("^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$") | not) | [.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name, .spec.containers[].env[]?.name] | @tsv'
```

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

According to the test results in https://github.com/HirazawaUi/verfiy-container-env, the container runtime is very lenient with using special characters as environment variables, and almost no failures will occur.

## Implementation History

\- 2023-12-21: Initial draft KEP

\- 2024-02-06: KEP promoted to implementable.

\- 2024-08-26: Promote to beta

\- 2024-08-27: Fixed some errors in the beta phase

\- 2025-01-23: Promote to GA

## Drawbacks

If the envvar name character set is extended,  all the things currently consuming and using envvar names from the API will have an impact and may break or be unsafe.

For example: 

* If a third party uses an envvar name as a filename and assumes that it is currently safe, then if it contains characters that cannot be used as a filename (like `:`) or characters that break the assumptions of a flat directory structure (like `/`), then unexpected results will occur.

## Alternatives

- do nothing (leave it as-is)

- relax the rule, but with a long beta period where the existing rule remains the default.
  Ensure that the beta period doesn't end until ValidatingAdmissionPolicy is GA and has been for 2 minor releases.
  *Clearly* document how to use a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to get behavior equivalent to the legacy checking,
  and signpost people to these docs when graduating the looser validation to be the Kubernetes default.

- define a label or annotation for each namespace that controls how Pod environment variables are validated in that namespace

- [more complex!]
  add an API kind to specify the validation rules for Pods

  Create a new API kind, eg PodValidationRule. It's **namespaced**. Within the `.spec` of each object, define:

  - a Pod selector
  - an optional CEL validation rule for environment variable keys
  - an optional CEL validation rule for environment variable values

  If any of the selected validation rules don't pass for a Pod, reject it at admission time. Set up a defaulting
  mechanism to
  Also, define how Pod templates interact with this new API (eg: you get a `Warning:` when you create
  a Deployment where the PodTemplate inside the Deployment wouldn't pass validation)
