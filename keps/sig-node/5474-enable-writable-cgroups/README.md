## Summary


## Motivation

In containerd v2.1.0, cgroup_writable configuration option was introduced to ensure that, when cgroup v2 is enabled, the cgroup interface (/sys/fs/cgroup) is mounted with read-write permissions. Currently, updating this setting requires stopping running workloads, modifying the containerd configuration, and restarting the service on every node.
To simplify adoption, and given that many runtimes already support a similar cgroup_writable setting, this field can be through the CRI interface.

### Graduation Criteria


### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy



### Version Skew Strategy



## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire



### Feature Enablement and Rollback


###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?



- [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?



###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?


###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?



### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning



###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?



###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?


###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?



###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?



### Monitoring Requirements



###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?



###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?



- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?



###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?



- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?



### Dependencies



###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?


### Scalability


###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?


###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?



### Troubleshooting



###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?



###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?
