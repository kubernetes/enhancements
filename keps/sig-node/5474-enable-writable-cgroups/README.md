## Summary

This KEP proposes adding a `WritableCgroups` field to the container SecurityContext in Kubernetes to allow unprivileged containers to have writable access to cgroup interfaces on cgroup v2 systems.

## Motivation

 With cgroup v2's secure delegation model, unprivileged containers can safely manage their own cgroup subtree without compromising system security. To support this, a configuration option can be introduced to ensure that, when cgroup v2 is enabled, the cgroup interface (/sys/fs/cgroup) is mounted with read-write permissions for containers.

By exposing the `WritableCgroups` field through the Kubernetes API and CRI interface, container runtimes can be updated to honor the setting via CRI, enabling unprivileged containers to take advantage of writable cgroups in a secure manner.

Related Issues:
- https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/10924
- https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/121190

### Goals

- Add a `WritableCgroups` boolean field to the container SecurityContext object
- CRI API changes
- Integrate with Pod Security Standards to ensure appropriate security policy enforcement
- Container runtime modifications
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workloads

## Proposal

Add a new `WritableCgroups *bool` field to the `SecurityContext` struct in the core v1 API. When set to `true` on cgroup v2 systems, this field will instruct the container runtime to mount the cgroup filesystem with write permissions for the container's own cgroup subtree.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: writable-cgroups-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:latest
    securityContext:
      writableCgroups: true
```

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1: Container-in-Container Development

As a developer, I need to run Docker-in-Docker for testing and development purposes. Currently, I need to use privileged containers which exposes unnecessary security risks. With `WritableCgroups`, I can run these nested containers securely while still allowing them to manage their own resource constraints.

#### Story 2: Dynamic Resource Management

As an application developer building a resource-intensive application, I want my application to be able to monitor its memory usage via `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current` and dynamically adjust its memory limits via `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max` based on workload patterns, without requiring privileged access or manual operator intervention.

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

- **cgroup v2 Only**: This feature requires cgroup v2 and will return an error on cgroup v1 systems
- **Linux Only**: The field is only valid on Linux containers and will be validated accordingly
- **Runtime Support**: Requires container runtime support
- **Security Context Integration**: Must work cohesively with other SecurityContext fields

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Security Bypass**: Containers gaining unauthorized access to system cgroups | Only allow write access to container's own cgroup subtree. cgroup v2 delegation model provides isolation |
| **Resource Exhaustion**: Containers setting inappropriate resource limits | Kubernetes resource quotas and limit ranges still apply. Container cannot exceed pod-level limits |
| **Pod Security Policy Bypass**: Feature being used in restricted environments | Integration with Pod Security Standards to block in restricted profiles |
| **Intra-Pod Resource Starvation**: A container in a Burstable or BestEffort Pod could modify its cgroup limits to consume resources intended for other containers in the same Pod, as no Pod-level cgroup enforces a ceiling. | Enforce that any container setting WritableCgroups: true must belong to a Pod that qualifies for the Guaranteed QoS class (where all containers have CPU and memory requests and limits set, and they are equal). This can be done via a validating admission policy or potentially in the normal validation code. This ensures Kubelet creates a pod-level cgroup that acts as a hard boundary for all containers within the pod. | 
| **Runtime Incompatibility**: Feature not working with older runtimes | Graceful degradation - field ignored if runtime doesn't support it |

## Design Details

### API Changes

#### Core API Types

Add `WritableCgroups *bool` field to `SecurityContext` in both internal and external API:

**File**: `pkg/apis/core/types.go`
```go
type SecurityContext struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // WritableCgroups controls whether the container has write access to cgroup interfaces.
    // This allows unprivileged containers to manage their own cgroup hierarchies on cgroup v2 systems.
    // Only effective on Linux containers with cgroup v2.
    // +optional
    WritableCgroups *bool
}
```

**Verify Runtime Support:**

1. Container runtime introspects its capabilities
2. Kubelet calls CRI Status() to get RuntimeHandlerFeatures  
3. Kubelet maps to internal RuntimeHandler structs
4. Node status update advertises capabilities via NodeRuntimeHandlerFeatures

**File**: `pkg/apis/core/types.go`
```go
type NodeRuntimeHandlerFeatures struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // WritableCgroups is set to true if the runtime handler supports writable cgroups
    // as implemented in Kubernetes SecurityContext.
    // +featureGate=WritableCgroups
    // +optional
    WritableCgroups *bool
}
```

**File**: `pkg/kubelet/container/runtime.go`
```go
type RuntimeHandler struct {
    Name string
    SupportsRecursiveReadOnlyMounts bool
    SupportsUserNamespaces bool
    SupportsWritableCgroups bool
}
```

#### CRI API Changes

**File**: `cri-api/pkg/apis/runtime/v1/api.proto`
```protobuf
message LinuxContainerSecurityContext {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // writable_cgroups controls whether the container has write access to cgroup interfaces.
    // Only effective with cgroup v2.
    bool writable_cgroups = 18;
}

// RuntimeHandlerFeatures is extended to advertise writable cgroups support
message RuntimeHandlerFeatures {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // writable_cgroups is set to true if the runtime handler supports
    bool writable_cgroups = 3;
}
```

    end
```

#### Validation

**Runtime Handler Validation**

A validation check will be added in `startContainer`. If the runtime does not support this field, the Kubelet should return an error.

**File**: `pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_container.go`
```go
func (m *kubeGenericRuntimeManager) startContainer(ctx context.Context, podSandboxID string, podSandboxConfig *runtimeapi.PodSandboxConfig, spec *startSpec, pod *v1.Pod) (string, error) {
    for _, c := range pod.Spec.Containers {
        if c.SecurityContext != nil && c.SecurityContext.WritableCgroups != nil {
            if !m.runtimeClassSupportsWritableCgroups(pod) {
                return fmt.Errorf("container %q requires writable cgroups but runtime handler %q does not support it", 
                    container.Name, spec.pod.Spec.RuntimeClassName)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**File**: `pkg/kubelet/kubelet_pods.go`
```go
func (kl *Kubelet) runtimeClassSupportsWritableCgroups(pod *v1.Pod) bool {
    if kl.runtimeClassManager == nil {
        return false
    }
    runtimeHandlerName, err := kl.runtimeClassManager.LookupRuntimeHandler(pod.Spec.RuntimeClassName)
    if err != nil {
        klog.ErrorS(err, "failed to look up the runtime handler", "runtimeClassName", pod.Spec.RuntimeClassName)
        return false
    }
    runtimeHandlers := kl.runtimeState.runtimeHandlers()
    return runtimeHandlerSupportsWritableCgroups(runtimeHandlerName, runtimeHandlers)
}

func runtimeHandlerSupportsWritableCgroups(runtimeHandlerName string, runtimeHandlers []kubecontainer.RuntimeHandler) bool {
    if len(runtimeHandlers) == 0 {
        return false
    }
    for _, h := range runtimeHandlers {
        if h.Name == runtimeHandlerName {
            return h.SupportsWritableCgroups
        }
    }
    klog.ErrorS(nil, "Unknown runtime handler", "runtimeHandlerName", runtimeHandlerName)
    return false
}
```



**System Validation**:

**File**: `pkg/apis/core/validation/validation.go`
```go
func ValidateSecurityContext(sc *core.SecurityContext, fldPath *field.Path) field.ErrorList {
    allErrs := field.ErrorList{}
    
    if sc.WritableCgroups != nil {
        // WritableCgroups is Linux-only
        if sc.WindowsOptions != nil {
            allErrs = append(allErrs, field.Invalid(fldPath.Child("WritableCgroups"), 
                sc.WritableCgroups, "cannot be set when WindowsOptions is specified"))
        }
    }
    
    return allErrs
}
```

**File**: `pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/security_context.go`
```go
func (m *kubeGenericRuntimeManager) determineEffectiveSecurityContext(pod *v1.Pod, container *v1.Container, uid *int64, username string) (*runtimeapi.LinuxContainerSecurityContext, error) {
    effectiveSc := securitycontext.DetermineEffectiveSecurityContext(pod, container)
    synthesized := convertToRuntimeSecurityContext(effectiveSc)
    
    // Add WritableCgroups validation (following existing pattern)
    if effectiveSc.WritableCgroups != nil {
        if !isCgroup2UnifiedMode() {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("writableCgroups requires cgroup v2")
        }
    }
    
    return synthesized, nil
}
```


**QoS Class Validation**:

```go
func ValidatePodSpec(spec *core.PodSpec, podMeta metav1.Object, fldPath *field.Path, opts PodValidationOptions) field.ErrorList {
    allErrs := field.ErrorList{}
    
    // Check if any container has WritableCgroups: true
    if hasWritableCgroups {
        tempPod := &core.Pod{Spec: *spec}
        qosClass := qos.ComputePodQOS(tempPod)
        if qosClass != core.PodQOSGuaranteed {
            allErrs = append(allErrs, field.Invalid(fldPath, spec, 
                "WritableCgroups=true requires Guaranteed QoS class (equal CPU/memory requests and limits for all containers)"))
        }
    }
    
    return allErrs
}
```

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

- Update existing SecurityContext validation tests to include WritableCgroups field
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing SecurityContext tests

##### Unit tests

Coverage for new and existing packages:

- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/core/validation`:  Unit tests for WritableCgroups validation logic, Linux-only constraints
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime`: Security context conversion tests including WritableCgroups mapping
- `k8s.io/pod-security-admission/policy`: Pod Security Standards policy enforcement tests
- `k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/core/v1`:  API defaulting and conversion tests

##### Integration tests

- `TestWritableCgroupsSecurityContextValidation`: API server validation integration test ensuring Linux-only enforcement
- `TestPodSecurityStandardsWritableCgroups`: Pod Security Standards admission controller integration test
- `TestKubeletSecurityContextConversion`: Kubelet CRI conversion integration test

##### e2e tests

- `test/e2e_node/writable_cgroup_test.go`: Node E2E tests covering:
  - Basic functionality (writable vs read-only cgroups)
  - Multi-container pods with mixed settings
  - Integration with other SecurityContext fields
  - cgroup v2 requirement validation
  - Pod validation failing for containers with writable cgroups but not "Guaranteed" QoS
  - Containers not able to "escape" the resource limits set by the Pod
  - Runtime compatibility checks

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha (v1.35)

- Feature implemented behind a feature gate `WritableCgroups`
- Basic API, validation, and kubelet implementation complete
- CRI API and container runtime changes
- Unit and integration tests implemented
- Pod Security Standards integration complete
- Node E2E tests passing on v2 systems

#### Beta (v1.36)

- Feature gate enabled by default
- E2E tests stable and passing consistently
- At least one runtime supporting the feature in a released version
- User feedback incorporated from alpha testing

#### GA (v1.37)

- Feature stable and ready for production use
- Conformance tests implemented where applicable
- Documentation completed

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

Enable/disable the feature gate

**Upgrade**: 
- New field is optional and defaults to `nil` (no change in behavior)
- Existing workloads continue to function without modification

**Update Flow**:
- `WritableCgroups` field is **immutable** after pod creation.
- Changes to `WritableCgroups` require pod recreation (delete + create)

**Downgrade**:

*Two scenarios depending on downgrade type:*

**Feature Gate Disabled (same Kubernetes version):**
- New pods with `WritableCgroups: true` will have the field silently dropped to `nil`
- Existing pods with `WritableCgroups: true` continue to work
- No errors occur - field is accepted but ignored

**True Version Downgrade (to Kubernetes version without WritableCgroups field):**
- Pods with `WritableCgroups` field will be **rejected** with strict decoding error: `unknown field "spec.containers[0].securityContext.writableCgroups"`
- Remove the field from pod specs before downgrading

### Version Skew Strategy

**kubelet vs Container Runtime**:
On unsupported runtimes, Kubelet will return an error.


## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire



### Feature Enablement and Rollback


###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: `WritableCgroups`
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kubelet, kube-apiserver
- [ ] Other

The feature can be controlled via:
1. **Feature Gate**: `--feature-gates=WritableCgroups=true/false`
2. **Runtime Support**: Requires compatible container runtime
3. **Pod Specification**: Per-container `securityContext.WritableCgroups` field

- Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control plane? **Yes**
- Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning of a node? **Yes** (kubelet restart required for feature gate changes)

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

**No**. The feature only affects containers that explicitly set `securityContext.WritableCgroups: true`. Default behavior remains unchanged - containers continue to have read-only access to cgroup filesystem.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

**Yes**. Disabling the feature gate will:
- Prevent new pods with `WritableCgroups: true` from being created
- Existing running containers continue with their current cgroup permissions until restart
- API server will reject new pods with the field set

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

New pods with `WritableCgroups: true` can be created again. No data loss or corruption occurs during disable/enable cycles.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

**Yes**. E2E tests will verify:
- Feature gate disabled: API rejects pods with writableCgroups field
- Feature gate enabled: API accepts and kubelet processes the field correctly
- Runtime compatibility testing with and without feature support



### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning



###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?



###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?


###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?



###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?



### Monitoring Requirements



###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?



###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?



- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?



###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?



- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?



### Dependencies



###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?


### Scalability


###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?



###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?


###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?



### Troubleshooting



###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?



###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

- **2025-08-25**: KEP written and proposed
- **TBD**: Alpha implementation targeting v1.35
- **TBD**: Beta implementation targeting v1.36
- **TBD**: GA implementation targeting v1.37

## Drawbacks

1. **Runtime Dependency**: Feature requires specific container runtime versions.
1. **Security Complexity**: Adds another security dimension that may need to be considered in Pod Security Standards

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Runtime-specific Annotations
Similar to CRI-O's `io.kubernetes.cri-o.cgroup2-mount-hierarchy-rw` annotation approach.

**Pros**: No API changes required
**Cons**: Runtime-specific, not portable, harder to enforce security policies

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

- **Runtime Support**: Coordination with container runtime projects to adopt CRI API changes
- **Documentation**: Updates to Kubernetes documentation and security guides
