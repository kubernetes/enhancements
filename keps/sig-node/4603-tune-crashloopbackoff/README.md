**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [x] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking

- [x] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the

- [x] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [x] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [x] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the

- [x] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

<!--
This section is incredibly important for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be
possible to collect this information before implementation begins, in order to
avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release
notes and implementing the feature itself. KEP editors and SIG Docs
should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is
useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md
-->

CrashLoopBackoff is designed to slow the speed at which failing containers
restart, preventing the starvation of kubelet by a misbehaving container.
Currently it is a subjectively conservative, fixed behavior regardless of
container failure type: when a Pod has a restart policy besides `Never`, after
containers in a Pod exit, the kubelet restarts them with an exponential back-off
delay (10s, 20s, 40s, …), that is capped at five minutes. The delay for restarts
will stay at 5 minutes until a container has executed for 2x the maximum backoff
-- that is, 10 minutes -- without any problems, in which case the kubelet resets
the backoff count for that container and further crash loops start again at the
beginning of the delay curve
([ref](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/)). 

Both the decay to 5 minute back-off delay, and the 10 minute recovery threshold,
are considered too conservative, especially in cases where the exit code was 0
(Success) and the pod is transitioned into a "Completed" state or the expected
length of the pod run is less than 10 minutes.

This KEP proposes the following changes:
* Provide 2 alpha-gated changes to get feedback and periodic scalability tests
  * Changes to the global initial backoff to 1s and maximum backoff to 1 minute
  * A knob to cluster operators to configure maximum backoff down, to minimum 1s, at the node level
* Formally split image pull backoff and container restart backoff behavior
* Formally split backoff counter reset threshold for container restart backoff
  behavior and maintain the current 10 minute recovery threshold

CrashLoopBackOffBehavior of today, with the proposed new default, and with the
proposed minimum per node configuration](./restarts-vs-elapsed-all.png "KEP-4603
CrashLoopBackoff proposal comparison")

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this KEP.  Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users. The
motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports] to
demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

[experience reports]: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

[Kubernetes#57291](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57291), with
over 250 positive reactions and in the top five upvoted issues in k/k, covers a
range of suggestions to change the rate of decay for the backoff delay or the
criteria to restart the backoff counter, in some cases requesting to make this
behavior tunable per node, per container, and/or per exit code. Anecdotally,
there are use cases representative of some of Kubernetes' most rapidly growing
workload types like
[gaming](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones/issues/2781) and
[AI/ML](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3329-retriable-and-non-retriable-failures)
that would benefit from this behavior being different for varying types of
containers. Application-based workarounds using init containers or startup
wrapper scripts, or custom operators like
[kube_remediator](https://github.com/ankilosaurus/kube_remediator) and
[descheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler) are used by the
community to anticipate crashloopbackoff behavior, prune pods with nonzero
backoff counters, or otherwise "pretend" the pod did not exit recently to force
a faster restart from kubelet. Discussions with early Kubernetes contributors
indicate that the current behavior was not designed beyond the motivation to
throttle misbehaving containers, and is open to reintepretation in light of user
experiences, empirical evidence, and emerging workloads.

By definition this KEP will cause pods to restart faster and more often than the
current status quo; let it be known that such a change is desired. It is also
the intention of the author that, to some degree, this change happens without
the need to reconfigure workloads or expose extensive API surfaces, as
experience shows that makes changes difficult to adopt, increases the risk for
misconfiguration, and can make the system overly complex to reason about. That
being said, this KEP recognizes the need of backoff times to protect node
stability, avoiding too big of sweeping changes to backoff behavior, or setting
unreasonable or unpredictable defaults. Therefore the approach manages the risk
of different decay curves to node stability by providing an API surface to
opt-in to the riskiest option, and ultimately also provides the observability
instrumentation needed by cluster operators to model the impact of this change
on their existing deployments.

A large number of alternatives have been discussed over the 5+ years the
canonical tracking issue has been open, some of which imply high levels of
sophistication for kubelet to make different decisions based on system state,
workload specific factors, or by detecting anomalous workload behavior. While
this KEP does not rule out those directions in the future, the proposal herein
focuses on the simpler, easily modeled changes that are designed to address the
most common issues observed today. It is the desire of the author that the
observability and benchmarking improvements instrumented as part of this
proposal can serve as a basis for pursuing those types of improvements in the
future, including as signals for end users to represent such solutions as
necessary. Some analysis of these alternatives are included in the Alternatives
Considered section below for future reference.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the KEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

* Improve pod restart backoff logic to better match the actual load it creates
  and meet emerging use cases
* Quantify and expose risks to node stability resulting from decreased and/or
  hetereogeneous backoff configurations
* Empirically derive defaults and allowable thresholds that approximate current
  node stability
* Provide a simple UX that does not require changes for the majority of
  workloads
* Must work for Jobs and sidecar containers

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this KEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

* This effort is NOT intending to support fully user-specified configuration, to
  cap risk to node stability
* This effort is purposefully NOT implementing more complex heuristics by
  kubelet (e.g. system state, workload specific factors, or by detecting
anomalous workload behavior) to focus on better benchmarking and observability
  and address common use cases with easily modelled changes first
* This effort is NOT changing the independent backoff curve for image pulls

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

This design seeks to incorporate a two-pronged approach:

1. Change the existing initial value for the backoff curve to 1s to stack more
   retries earlier, and reduce the maximum backoff for a given restart from 5
   minutes to 1 minute, for all restarts (`restartPolicy: OnFailure` and
   `restartPolicy: Always`)
2. Provide an option to cluster operators to configure an even lower maximum
backoff for all containers on a specific Node, down to 1s

To derive these values, manual stress testing observing the behavior of kubelet,
   API server, and overall cluster operations and behavior were performed. In
addition, part of the alpha period will be dedicated entirely to systematically
stress testing kubelet and API Server with different distributions of workloads
utilizing the new backoff curves. During the benchmarking period in alpha,
kubelet memory and CPU, API server latency, and pod restart latency will be
observed and analyzed to further refine the maximum allowable restart rate for
fully saturated nodes.

Longer term, these
metrics will also supply cluster operators the data necessary to better analyze
and anticipate the change in load and node stability as a result of upgrading to
these changes.

While they are more deeply rationalized in the Alternatives Considered section,
because they are commonly inquired about at this point, note that this proposal
will NOT change:
* backoff behavior for Pods transitioning from the "Success" state differently
  from those transitioning from a "Failed" state -- see [here in Alternatives
  Considered](#on-success-and-the-10-minute-recovery-threshold)
* the ImagePullBackoff -- out of scope, see [Design
  Details](#relationship-with-imagepullbackoff)
* changes that address 'late recovery', or modifications to backoff behavior
  once the maximum backoff has been reached -- see
  [Alternatives](#more-complex-heuristics)



### Existing backoff curve change: front loaded decay, lower maximum backoff

This KEP proposes changing the existing backoff curve to load more restarts
earlier by changing the initial value of the exponential backoff, and to retry
periodically more often by reducing the maximum for the backoff. A number of
alternate initial values and maximum backoff values are modelled below. This
proposal suggests we start with a new initial value of 1s (changed from 10s
today) and a maximum backoff of 1 minute (changed from 5 minutes today) based on
prior research, and further analyze its impact on infrastructure during alpha. 

![A graph showing the change in elapsed time for observed restarts with the
CrashLoopBackOffBehavior of today vs the proposed new
default](./restarts-vs-elapsed-new-default.png "Default backoff curve change")


### Node specific kubelet config for maximum backoff down to 1 second

This KEP also proposes providing a more flexible mechanism for modifying the
maximum backoff as an opt-in. The configuration for this will be per node, by an
integer representing seconds (notably NOT resulting in subsecond granularity).
The minimum allowable value will be 1 second. The maximum allowable value will
be 300 seconds. This per node configuration will be configurable only by a user
with awareness of the node holistically.

![A graph showing the change in elapsed time for observed restarts with the
CrashLoopBackOffBehavior of today vs the proposed minimum for per node
configuration](./restarts-vs-elapsed-minimum-per-node.png "Per node minimum backoff
curve allowed")

While the complete information is saved for [Design Details](#per-node-config),
its expedient to see the exact config proposed here:

```
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
crashloopbackoff: 
  maxSeconds: 4
```

### Refactor and flat rate to 10 minutes for the backoff counter reset threshold

Finally, this KEP proposes factoring out the backoff counter reset threshold for
CrashLoopBackoff behavior induced restarts into a new constant. Instead of being
proportional to the configured maximum backoff, it will instead be a flat rate
equivalent to the current implementation, 10 minutes. This will only apply to
backoff counter resets from CrashLoopBackoff behavior.


### User Stories

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Task isolation
By design the container wants to exit so it will be recreated and restarted to
start a new “session” or “task”. It may be a new gaming session or a new
isolated task processing an item from the queue.

This is not possible to do by creating the wrapper of a container that will
restart the process in a loop because those tasks or gaming sessions desire to
start from scratch. In some cases - they may even want to download a new
container image.

For these cases, it is important that the startup latency of the full
rescheduling of a new pod is avoided.

#### Fast restart on failure

There are AI/ML scenarios where an entire workload is delayed if one of the Pods
is not running. Some Pods in this scenario may fail with the recoverable error -
for example some dependency failure or be killed by infrastructure (e.g. exec
probe failures on containerd slow restart). In such cases, it is desirable to
restart the container as fast as possible and not wait for 5 minutes of the max
crashloop backoff timeout. With the existing max crashloop backoff timeout, a
failure of a single pod in a highly-coupled workload can cause a cascade in the
workload leading to an overall delay of (much) greater than the 5 minute
backoff.

The typical pattern here today is to be quick to restart container, but with the
intermittently failed dependency (e.g. network is down for some time, some
intermittent issue with a GPU), this causes the container to fail repeatedly and
the backoff timeout to eventually be reached. However when the dependency goes
back to green, the container is not restarted immediately and has already
reached the maximum crash loop backoff duration of 5 minutes.

#### Sidecar containers fast restart

There are cases when the Pod consists of a user container implementing business
logic and a sidecar providing networking access (Istio), logging (opentelemetry
collector), or orchestration features. In some cases sidecar containers are
critical for the user container functioning as they provide a basic
infrastructure for the user container to run in. In such cases it is considered
beneficial to not apply the exponential backoff to the sidecar container
restarts and keep it at a low constant value.

This is especially true for cases when the sidecar is killed by infrastructure
(e.g. OOMKill) as it may have happened for reasons independent from the sidecar
functionality.


### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are some important details that didn't come across above?
Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
This might be a good place to talk about core concepts and how they relate.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

The biggest risk of this proposal is reducing the decay of the _default_
CrashLoopBackoff: to do so too severely compromises node stability, risking the
kubelet component to become too slow to respond and the pod lifecycle to
increase in latency, or worse, causing entire nodes to crash if kubelet takes up
too much CPU or memory. Since each phase transition for a Pod also has an
accompanying API request, if the requests become rapid enough due to fast enough
churn of Pods through CrashLoopBackoff phases, the central API server could
become unresponsive, effectively taking down an entire cluster.

The same risk exists for the per Node feature, which, while not default, is by
design allowing a more severe reduction in the decay behavior. In the worst
case, it could cause nodes to fully saturate with near-instantly restarting pods
that will never recover, risking similar issues as above: taking down nodes or
at least nontrivially slowing kubelet, or increasing the API requests to store
backoff state so significantly that the central API server is unresponsive and
the cluster fails.

Some observations and analysis were made to quantify these risks going into
alpha. In the [Kubelet Overhead Analysis](#kubelet-overhead-analysis), the code
paths all restarting pods go through result in 5 obvious `/pods` API server
status updates; when observed empirically in an active cluster, while we do see
an initial surges in `/pods` API traffic to the kubelet client side rate limit
of ~5 QPS when deploying 110 mass crashing pods for our tests, even with
instantly crashing pods and intantaneously restarting CrashLoopBackOff behavior,
`/pods` API requests quickly normalized to ~2 QPS. In the same tests, runtime
CPU usage increased by x10 and the API server CPU usage increased by 2x.
<<[UNRESOLVED non blocking]If you were testing this on a small cluster without a lot of
additional load, the 2x increase in apiserver cpu usage is probably not a
particularly useful metric. Might be worth mentioning the raw numbers here
instead.>> <<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

For both of these changes, by passing these changes through the existing
SIG-scalability tests, while pursuing manual and more detailed periodic
benchmarking during the alpha period, we can increase the confidence in the
changes and explore the possibility of reducing the values further in the
future.

In the meantime, during alpha, naturally the first line of defense is that the
enhancements, even the reduced "default" baseline curve for CrashLoopBackoff,
are not usable by default and must be opted into. In this specific case they are
opted into separately with different alpha feature gates, so clusters will only
be affected by each risk if the cluster operator enables the new features during
the alpha period.

Beyond this, there are two main mitigations during alpha: conservativism in
changes to the default behavior based on prior stress testing, and limiting any
further overrides to be opt-in per Node, and only by users with the permissions
to modify the kubelet configuration -- in other words, a cluster operator
persona.

The alpha changes to the _default_ backoff curve were chosen because they meet
emerging use cases and user sentiment from the canonical feature request issue
and research by the author, AND because they are indicated to be safe changes
based on initial benchmarking and analysis. The reduction of the initial value
from 10s to 1s and the reduction of the backoff maximum from 5 minutes to 1
minute introduces 

* 5 excess restarts per pod in the first five minutes
  * the first 3 excess in the first 30 seconds
  * and the last 2 excess between 150 and 300 seconds
  * an excess 5 restarts every five minutes compared to today given the change
    in the backoff maximum

For a hypothetical node with the default maximum 110 pods all stuck in a
simultaneous 10s CrashLoopBackoff, at its most efficient this would result in a
new restart for each pod every second, and API requests to the API server to
change the state transition would increase at its fastest period from ~550
requests/10s to ~5500 requests/10s, or 10x. In conjunction, the lowered backoff
would continuously add 5 excess restarts every five minutes compared to today's
behavior, so each crashing pod would be adding an excess of 25 pod state
transition API requests, for a total of 2750 excess API requests for a node
fully saturated with crashing pods.

For the per node case, because the change could be more significant, with nearly
trivial (when compared to pod startup metrics) max allowable backoffs of 1s,
there is more risk to node stability expected. This change is of particular
interest to be tested in the alpha period by end users, and is why it is still
included, but only by opt-in. In this case, for a hypothetical node with the
default maximum 110 pods each with one crashing container all stuck in a
simultaneous 1s maximum CrashLoopBackoff, as above, at its most efficient this
would result in a new restart for each pod every second, and therefore the API
requests to change the state transition would be expected to increase from ~550
requests/10s to 5500 requests/10s, or 10x. In addition, since the maximum
backoff would be lowered, an ideal pod would continue to restart more often than
today's behavior, adding 305 excess restarts within the first 5 minutes and 310
excess restarts every 5 minutes after that; each crashing pod would be
contributing an excess of ~1550 pod state transition API requests, and fully
saturated node with a full 110 crashing pods would be adding 170,500 new pod
transition API requests every five minutes, which is an an excess of ~568
requests/10s. <<[!UNRESOLVED non blocking: kubernetes default for the kubelet
client rate limit and how this changes by machine size]>> <<[UNRESOLVED]>>

change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your

### Front loaded decay curve, modified maximum backoff methodology
As mentioned above, today the standard backoff curve is a 2x exponential decay
starting at 10s and capping at 5 minutes, resulting in a composite of the
standard hockey-stick exponential decay graph followed by a linear rise until
the heat death of the universe as depicted below:

![A graph showing the backoff decay for a Kubernetes pod in
CrashLoopBackoff](./crashloopbackoff-succeedingcontainer.png "CrashLoopBackoff
decay")

Remember that the backoff counter is reset if containers run longer than 10
minutes, so in the worst case where a container always exits after 9:59:59, this
means in the first 30 minute period, the container will restart twice. In a more
easily digestible example used in models below, for a fast exiting container
crashing every 10 seconds, in the first 30 minutes the container will restart
about 10 times, with the first four restarts in the first 5 minutes.

Why change the initial value of the backoff curve instead of its rate, or why
not change the decay function entirely to other well known equations (like
functions resulting in curves that are lienar, parabolic, sinusoidal, etc)?

Exponential decay, particularly at a rate of 2x, is commonly used for software
retry backoff as it has the nice properties of starting restarts at a low value,
but penalizing repeated crashes harshly, to protect primarily against
unrecoverable failures. In contrast, we can interpret linear curves as
penalizing every failure the same, or parabolic and sinusoidal curves as giving
our software a "second chance" and forgiving later failures more. For a default
restart decay curve, where the cause of the restart cannot be known, 2x
exponential decay still models the desired properties more, as the biggest risk
is unrecoverable failures causing "runaway" containers to overload kubelet.

To determine the effect in abstract of changing the initial value on current
behavior, we modeled the change in the starting value of the decay from 10s to
1s, 250ms, or even 25ms. 

!["A graph showing the decay curves for different initial values"](differentinitialvalues.png
"Alternate CrashLoopBackoff initial values")

For today's decay rate, the first restart is within the first 10s, the second
within the first 30s, the third within the first 70s. Using those same time
windows to compare alternate initial values, for example changing the initial
rate to 1s, we would instead have 3 restarts in the first time window, 1 restart
within the second time window, and two more restarts within the third time
window. As seen below, this type of change gives us more restarts earlier, but
even at 250ms or 25ms initial values, each approach a similar rate of restarts
after the third time window.

![A graph showing different exponential backoff decays for initial values of
10s, 1s, 250ms and 25ms](initialvaluesandnumberofrestarts.png "Changes to decay
with different initial values")

Among these modeled initial values, we would get between 3-7 excess restarts per
backoff lifetime, mostly within the first three time windows matching today's
restart behavior.

The above modeled values converge like this because of the harshly increasing
rate caused by the exponential growth, but also because they grow to the same
maximum value -- 5 minutes. By layering on alternate models for maximum backoff,
we observe more restarts for longer:

![A graph showing different exponential backoff decays for 2 initial values and
2 different maximum backoff
thresholds](initialvaluesandmaxonnumberofrestarts.png "Changes to decay with
different initial and maximum backoff values")

While this graph includes several variations -- initial values of 10s in red and
pink, initial values of 1s in purple and lilac, and both of these initial values
modeled either 60s or 30s maximum backoff -- hopefully it can impress upon the
reader how including a reduction to maximum backoff increases the number of
excess restarts later in the cycle. In the most extreme case modeled above, with
initial value of 1s and a maximum backoff of 30s, there are 2 excess restarts in
the first time window, 1 excess in the second time window, 3 excess in the
fourth time window and 4 excess in the fifth time window for a total of 10
excess restarts compared to today's behavior.

As a first estimate for alpha in line with maximums discussed on
[Kubernetes#57291](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57291), the
initial curve is selected at initial=1s / max=1 minute. During the alpha period
this will be further investigated against kubelet capacity, potentially
targeting something closer to an initial value near 0s, and a cap of 10-30s. To
further restrict the blast radius of this change before full and complete
benchmarking is worked up, this is gated by its own feature gate,
`ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay`.

### Per node config

For some users in
[Kubernetes#57291](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57291), any
delay over 1 minute at any point is just too slow, even if it is legitimately
crashing. A common refrain is that for independently recoverable errors,
especially system infrastructure events or recovered external dependencies, or
for absolutely nonnegotiably critical sidecar pods, users would rather poll more
often or more intelligently to reduce the amount of time a workload has to wait
to try again after a failure. In the extreme cases, users want to be able to
configure (by container, node, or exit code) the backoff to close to 0 seconds.
This KEP considers it out of scope to implement fully user-customizable
behavior, and too risky without full and complete benchmarking to node stability
to allow legitimately crashing workloads to have a backoff of 0, but it is in
scope for the first alpha to provide users a way to opt in to a even
faster restart behavior.

So why opt in by node? In fact, the initial proposal of this KEP for 1.31 was to
opt in by Pod, to minimize the blast radius of a given Pod's worst case restart
behavior. In 1.31 this was proposed using a new `restartPolicy` value in the Pod
API, described in [Alternatives Considered here](#restartpolicy-rapid). Concerns
with this approach fell into two buckets: 1. technical issues with the API
(which could have been resolved by a different API approach), and 2. design
issues with exposing this kind of configuration to users without holistic
insight into cluster operations, for example, to users who might have pod
manifest permissions in their namespace but not for other namespaces in the same
cluster and which might be dependent on the same kubelet. For 1.32, we were
looking to address the second issue by moving the configuration somewhere we
could better guarantee a cluster operator type persona would have exclusive
access to. In addition, initial manual stress testing and benchmarking indicated
that even in the unlikely case of mass pathologically crashing and instantly
restarting pods across an entire node, cluster operations proceeded with
acceptable latency, disk, cpu and memory. Worker polling loops, context
timeouts, the interaction between various other backoffs, as well as API server
rate limiting made up the gap to the stability of the system. Therefore, to
simplify both the implementation and the API surface, this 1.32 proposal puts
forth that the opt-in will be configured per node via kubelet configuration.

Kubelet configuration is governed by two main input points, 1) command-line flag
based config and 2) configuration following the API specification of the
`kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 KubeletConfiguration` Kind, which is passed to
kubelet as a config file or, beta as of Kubernetes 1.30, a config directory
([ref](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/)).

Since this is a per-node configuration that likely will be set on a subset of
nodes, or potentially even differently per node, it's important that it can be
manipulated per node. Expected use cases of this type of heterogeneity in
configuration include

* Dedicated node pool for workloads that are expected to rapidly restart
* Config aligned with node labels/pod affinity labels for workloads that are
  expected to rapidly restart
* Machine size adjusted config

By default `KubeletConfiguration` is intended to be shared
between nodes, but the beta feature for drop-in configuration files in a
colocated config directory cirumvent this. In addition, `KubeletConfiguration`
drops fields unrecognized by the current kubelet's schema, making it a good
choice to circumvent compatibility issues with n-3 kubelets. While there is an
argument that this could be better manipulated with a command-line flag, so
lifecycle tooling that configures nodes can expose it more transparently, that
was an acceptable design change given the introduction of `KubeletConfiguration`
in the first place. In any case, the advantages to backwards and forward
compatibility by far outweigh this consideration for the alpha period and can be
revisted before beta.

The proposed configuration explicitly looks like this:

```
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
crashloopbackoff: 
  maxSeconds: 4
```

### Refactor of recovery threshold

A simple change
to maximum backoff would naturally come with a modification of the backoff
counter reset threshold -- as it is currently calculated based on 2x the maximum
backoff. Without any other modification, as a result of this KEP, default
containers would be "rewarded" by having their backoff counter set back to 0 for
running successfully for 2\*1 minute=2 minutes (instead of for 2\*5minutes=10
minutes like it is today); containers on nodes with an override could be
rewarded for running successfully for as low as 2 seconds if they are configured
with the minimum allowable backoff of 1s. 

From a technical perspective, granularity of the associated worker polling loops
governing restart behavior is between 1 and 10 seconds, so a reset value under
10 seconds is effectively meaningless (until and unless those loops increase in
speed or we move to evented PLEG). From a user perspective, it does not seem
that there is any particular end user value in artificially preserving the
current 10 minute recovery threshold as part of this implementation, since it
was an arbitrary value in the first place. However, since late recovery as a
category of problem space is expressly a non-goal of this KEP, and in the
interest of reducing the number of changed variables during the alpha period to
better observe the ones previously enumerated, this proposal intends to maintain
that 10 minute recovery threshold anyways. 

Forecasting that the recovery threshold for CrashLoopBackOff may be better
served by being configurable in the future, or at least separated in the code
from all other uses of `client_go.Backoff` for whatever future enhancements
address the late recovery problem space, the mechanism proposed here is to
redefine  `client_go.Backoff` to accept alternate functions for
[`client_go.Backoff.hasExpired`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/util/flowcontrol/backoff.go#L178),
and configure the `client_go.Backoff` object created for use by the kube runtime
manager for container restart bacoff with a function that compares to a flat
rate of 300 seconds.

### Conflict resolution

Depending on the enablement state of the alpha gates and the configuration of an
individual node, some conflicts may need to be resolved to determine the initial
value or maximum backoff for a given node. See the [Upgrade/Downgrade Strategy
section](#upgrade--downgrade-strategy) for more details.

### Kubelet overhead analysis

As it's intended that, after this KEP, pods will restart more often that in
current Kubernetes, it's important to understand what the kubelet does during
pod restarts. The most informative code path for that is through (all links to
1.31) [`kubelet/kubelet.go
SyncPod`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go),
[`kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go
SyncPod`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L1052),
[`kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_container.go
startContainer`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_container.go#L195)
and [`kubelet/kubelet.go SyncTerminatingPod`](),
[`kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_container.go
killContainer`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_container.go#L761),

!["A sequence diagram showing Kubelet and Container Runtime code paths
responsible for behaviors common to all pod
restarts"](kubeletvsruntime-restartresponsibility.png "High level Kubelet and
Container Runtime restart code paths")


As you might imagine this is a very critical code path with hooks to many
in-flight features; [Appendix A](#appendix-a) includes a more complete list (yet
still not as exhaustive as the source code), but the following are selected as
the most important behaviors of kubelet during a restart to know about, that are
not currently behind a feature gate.

After a Pod is in Terminating phase, kubelet:

* Clears up old containers using container runtime
* Stops probes and pod sandbox, and unmounts volumes and unregisters
  secrets/configmaps (since Pod was in a terminal phase)
* While still in the backoff window, wait for network / attach volumes /
  register pod to secret and configmap managers / re-download image secrets if
  necessary

Once the current backoff window has passed, kubelet:

* Potentially re-downloads the image (utilizing network + IO and blocks other
  image downloads) if image pull policy specifies it
  ([ref](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/pkg/kubelet/images/image_manager.go#L135)).
* Recreates the pod sandbox and probe workers
* Recreates the containers using container runtime
* Runs user configured prestart and poststart hooks for each container
* Runs startup probes until containers have started (startup probes may be more
  expensive than the readiness probes as they often configured to run more
  frequently)
* Redownloads all secrets and configmaps, as the pod has been unregistered and
  reregistered to the managers, while computing container environment/EnvVarFrom
* Application runs through its own initialization logic (typically utilizing
  more IO)
* Logs information about all container operations (utilizing disk IO and
  “spamming” logs)

The following diagram showcases these same highlights more visually and in
context of the responsible API surface (Kubelet or Runtime aka CRI).

!["A diagram showing Kubelet and Container Runtime code paths responsible for
behaviors common to all pod restarts"](code-diagram-for-restarts.png "Kubelet
and Container Runtime restart code paths")

 to answer question: looks like it is per runtime. need to check about leasees. also part of the value of this is to restart the sandbox.
```

### Benchmarking

Again, let it be known that by definition this KEP will cause pods to restart
faster and more often than the current status quo and such a change is desired.
However, to do so as safely as possible, it is required that during the alpha
period, we reevaluate the SLIs and SLOs and benchmarks related to this change and
expose clearly the methodology needed for cluster operators to be able to quantify the
risk posed to their specific clusters on upgrade.

To best reason about the changes in this KEP, we require the ability to
determine, for a given percentage of heterogenity between "Succeeded"
terminating pods, and "Failed" (aka crashing) terminating pods whose
`restartPolicy: Always`:
 * what is the load and rate of Pod restart related API requests to the API
   server?
 * what are the performance (memory, CPU, and pod start latency) effects on the
   kubelet component? What about when considering the effects of different
   plugins (e.g. CSI, CNI)

Today there are alpha SLIs in Kubernetes that can observe that impact in
aggregate:
* Kubelet component CPU and memory
* `kubelet_http_inflight_requests`
* `kubelet_http_requests_duration_seconds`
* `kubelet_http_requests_total`
* `kubelet_pod_worker_duration_seconds`
* `kubelet_runtime_operations_duration_seconds`
* `kubelet_pod_start_duration_seconds`
* `kubelet_pod_start_sli_duration_seconds`

In addition, estimates given the currently suggested changes in API requests are
included in [Risks and Mitigations](#risks-and-mitigations) and were deciding
factors in specific changes to the backoff curves. Since the changes in this
proposal are deterministic, this is pre-calculatable for a given heterogenity of
quantity and rate of restarting pods.

In addition, the `kube-state-metrics` project already implements
restart-specific metadata for metrics that can be used to observe pod restart
latency in more detail, including:
* `kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total`
* `kube_pod_restart_policy`
* `kube_pod_start_time`
* `kube_pod_created`

During the alpha period, these metrics, the SIG-Scalability benchmarking tests,
added kubelet performance tests, and manual benchmarking by the author against
`kube-state-metrics` will be used to answer the above questions, tying together
the container restart policy (inherited or declared), the terminal state of a
container before restarting, and the number of container restarts, to articulate
the observed rate and load of restart related API requests and the performance
effects on kubelet.

### Relationship with Job API podFailurePolicy and backoffLimit

Job API provides its own API surface for describing alterntive restart
behaviors, from [KEP-3329: Retriable and non-retriable Pod failures for
Jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3329-retriable-and-non-retriable-failures),
in beta as of Kubernetes 1.30. The following example from that KEP shows the new
configuration options: `backoffLimit`, which controls for number of retries on
failure, and `podFailurePolicy`, which controls for types of workload exit codes
or kube system events to ignore against that `backoffLimit`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Job
spec:
  [ . . . ]
  backoffLimit: 3
  podFailurePolicy:
    rules:
    - action: FailJob
      onExitCodes:
        containerName: main-job-container
        operator: In
        values: [1,2,3]
    - action: Ignore
      onPodConditions:
      - type: DisruptionTarget
```

The implementation of KEP-3329 is entirely in the Job controller, and the
restarts are not handled by kubelet at all; in fact, use of this API is only
available if the `restartPolicy` is set to `Never` (though
[kubernetes#125677](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/125677)
wants to relax this validation to allow it to be used with other `restartPolicy`
values). As a result, to expose the new backoff curve to Jobs using this
feature, the updated backoff curve must also be implemented in the Job
controller. This is currently considered out of scope of the first alpha
implementation of this design.

### Relationship with ImagePullBackOff

ImagePullBackoff is used, as the name suggests, only when a container needs to
pull a new image. If the image pull fails, a backoff decay is used to make later
retries on the image download wait longer and longer. This is configured
internally independently
([here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.30/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L606))
from the backoff for container restarts
([here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.30/pkg/kubelet/kubelet.go#L855)).

This KEP considers changes to ImagePullBackoff as out of scope, so during
implementation this will keep the same backoff. This is both to reduce the
number of variables during the benchmarking period for the restart counter, and
because the problem space of ImagePullBackoff could likely be handled by a
completely different pattern, as unlike with CrashLoopBackoff the types of
errors with ImagePullBackoff are less variable and better interpretable by the
infrastructure as recoverable or non-recoverable (i.e. 404s).

### Relationship with k/k#123602

It was observed that there is a bug with the current requeue behavior, described
in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/123602. The first restart
will have 0 seconds delay instead of the advertised initial value delay, because
the backoff object will not be initialized until a key is generated, which
doesn't happen until after the first restart of a pod (see
[ref](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a7ca13ea29ba5b3c91fd293cdbaec8fb5b30cee2/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/kuberuntime_manager.go#L1336-L1349)).
That first restart will also not impact future backoff calculations, so the
observed behavior is closer to:

* 0 seconds delay for first restart
* 10 seconds for second restart
* 10 * 2^(restart_count - 2) for subsequent restarts

By watching a crashing pod, we can observe that it does not enter a
CrashLoopBackoff state or behave as advertised until after that first "free"
restart:

```
# a pod that crashes every 10s
thing  0/1  Pending  0 29s
thing  0/1  Pending  0 97s
thing  0/1  ContainerCreating  0 97s
thing  1/1  Running  0 110s           
thing  0/1  Completed  0 116s                       # first run completes
thing  1/1  Running  1 (4s ago)  118s               # no crashloopbackoff observed, 1 restart tracked
thing  0/1  Completed  1 (10s ago)  2m4s            # second runc ompletes
thing  0/1  CrashLoopBackOff 1 (17s ago)  2m19s     # crashloopbackoff observed
thing  1/1  Running  2 (18s ago)  2m20s             # third run starts
thing  0/1  Completed  2 (23s ago)  2m25s
thing  0/1  CrashLoopBackOff 2 (14s ago)  2m38s     # crashloopbackoff observed again
thing  1/1  Running  3 (27s ago)  2m51s
thing  0/1  Completed  3 (32s ago)  2m56s
```

Ultimately, being able to predict the exact number of restarts or remedying up
to 10 seconds delay for the advertised behavior is not the ultimate goal of this
KEP, though certain assumptions were made when calculating risks, mitigations,
and analyzing existing behavior that are affected by this bug. Since the
behavior is already changing as part of this KEP, and similar code paths will be
changed, it is within scope of this KEP to address this bug if it is a blocker
to implementation for alpha; it can wait until beta otherwise. This is
represented below in the [Graduation Criteria](#graduation-criteria).

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*
The goal is to ensure that we don't accept enhancements with inadequate testing.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

This feature requires two levels of testing: the regular enhancement testing
(described in the template below) and the stress/benchmark testing required to
increase confidence in ongoing node stability given heterogeneous backoff timers
and timeouts.

Some stress/benchmark testing will still be developed as part of the
implementation of this enhancement, including the kubelet_perf tests indicated
in the e2e section below.

Some of the benefit of pursuing this change in alpha is to also have the
opportunity to run against the existing SIG-Scalability performance and
benchmarking tests within an alpha candidate. In addition, manual benchmark
testing with GKE clusters can be performed by the author as described in [Design
Details](#benchmarking), and evaluated as candidates for formal, periodic
benchmark testing in the Kubernetes testgrid.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:

The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.

- 2 Kubernetes releases soak in beta
- Completely finalize the decay curves and document them thoroughly
- Remove the feature flag code
- Confirm the exponential backoff decay curve related tests and code are still
  in use elsewhere and do not need to be removed
- Conformance test added for per-node configuration

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, [feature gate] graduations, or as
something else. The KEP should keep this high-level with a focus on what
signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

For `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay`:

For an existing cluster, no changes are required to configuration, invocations
or API objects to make an upgrade.

To use the enhancement, the alpha feature gate is turned on. In the future when
(/if) the feature gate is removed, no configurations would be required to be
made, and the default behavior of the baseline backoff curve would -- by design
-- be changed.

To stop use of this enhancement, the entire cluster must be restarted or just
kubelet must restart with the `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay` feature gate
turned off. Since kubelet does not cache the backoff object, on kubelet restart
Pods will start at the beginning of their backoff curve. The exact backoff curve
a given Pod will use will be either the original one with initial value 10s, or
the per-node configured maximum backoff if the
`EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax` feature gate is turned on. 

For `EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax`:

For an existing cluster, no changes are required to configuration, invocations
or API objects to make an upgrade.

To make use of this enhancement, on cluster upgrade, the
`EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax` feature gate must first be turned on for the
cluster. Then, if any nodes need to use a different backoff curve, their kubelet
must be completely redeployed either in the same upgrade or after that upgrade
with the `crashloopbackoff.maxSeconds` `KubeletConfiguration` set.

To stop use of this enhancement, there are two options. 

On a per-node basis, nodes can be completely redeployed with
`crashloopbackoff.maxSeconds` `KubeletConfiguration` unset. Since kubelet does
not cache the backoff object, on kubelet restart they will start from the
beginning of their backoff curve (either the original one with initial value
10s, or the new baseline with initial value 1s, depending on whether they've
turned on the `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay` feature gate).

Or, the entire cluster can be restarted with the
`EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax` feature gate turned off. In this case, any
Node configured with a different backoff curve will instead use
the default backoff curve. Again, since the cluster was restarted and Pods were
redeployed, they will not maintain prior state and will start at the beginning
of their backoff curve. Also, again the exact backoff curve they will use will
be either the original one with initial value 10s, or the new baseline with
initial value 1s, depending on whether they've turned on the
`ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay` feature gate.

#### Conflict resolution

If on a given node at a given time, the per-node configured maximum backoff is
lower than the initial value, the initial value for that node will instead be
set to the configured maximum. For example, if
`ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay` is turned off so the initial value is 10s,
but `EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax` is turned on and a given node is
configured to a maximum of `1s`, then the initial value for that node will be
configured to 1s. In other words, operator-invoked configuration will have
precedence over the default if it is faster.

If on a given node at a given time, the per-node configured maximum backoff is
lower than 1 second or higher than the 300s, validation will fail and the
kubelet will crash/be unable to start, like it does with other invalid kubelet
configuration today.

If on a given node at a given time, the per-node configured maximum backoff is
higher than the default maximum backoff, but within validation limits as it is
lower than 300s, it will be honored. In other words, operator-invoked
configuration for the maximum backoff will have precedence over the default, even if it is slower, as
long as it is valid.

If `crashloopbackoff.maxSeconds` `KubeletConfiguration` exists but
`EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax` is off, kubelet will log a warning but will
not honor the `crashloopbackoff.maxSeconds` `KubeletConfiguration`. In other words,
operator-invoked per node configuration will not be honored if the overall
feature gate is turned off.

scenario | ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay | EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax | Effective initial value | Effective maximum value
---------|---------|----------|---------|---------
_today's behavior_ | disabled | disabled | 10s | 300s
_new default only_ | enabled | disabled | 1s | 60s
_faster per node config_ | disabled | 60s | 10s | 60s
" | disabled | 2s | 2s | 2s
" | enabled | 2s | 1s | 2s
" | enabled | 30s | 1s | 30s 
_slower per node config_  |  enabled | 300s | 1s | 300s
" |  enabled | 61s | 1s | 61s
_valid node config that reimplements today's behavior_ |  disabled | 300s | 10s | 300s
_invalid per node config_ | disabled | 301s | kubelet crashes
" | enabled | 301s | kubelet crashes


### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and nodes?
- How does an n-3 kubelet or kube-proxy without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- How does an n-1 kube-controller-manager or kube-scheduler without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

For both the default backoff curve and the per-node, no coordination must be
done between the control plane and the nodes; all behavior changes are local to
the kubelet component and its start up configuration. An n-3 kube-proxy, n-1
kube-controller-manager, or n-1 kube-scheduler without this feature available is
not affected when this feature is used, nor will different CSI or CNI
implementations. Code paths that will be touched are exclusively in kubelet
component.

An n-3 kubelet without this feature available will behave like normal, with the
original CrashLoopBackOff behavior. It will drop unrecognized fields in
`KubeletConfiguration` by default for per node config so if one is specified on
start up in a past kubelet version, it will not break kubelet (though the
behavior will, of course, not change).

While the CRI is a consumer of the result of this change (as it will receive
more requests to start containers), it does not need to be updated at all to
take advantage of this feature as the restart logic is entirely in process of
the kubelet component.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay`
    - Components depending on the feature gate: `kubelet`
  - Feature gate name: `EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax`
    - Components depending on the feature gate: `kubelet`

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

<!--
Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
automations, so be extremely careful here.
-->

Yes, `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay` changes the default backoff curve for
exiting Pods (including sidecar containers) when `restartPolicy` is either `OnFailure`
or `Always`.

Since we currently only have anecdotal benchmarking, the alpha will implement
more conservative modeled initial value and maximum backoff, though less
conservative from the 1.31 proposal as initial manual data indicated faster
maximum backoff caps were safe. The new values for all CrashLoopBackOff behavior
for all workloads will be initial value=1s, max=60s. (See [this
section](#front-loaded-decay-curve-modified-maximum-backoff-methodology) for
more rationale.)

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

<!--
Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
feature, can it break the existing applications?).

Feature gates are typically disabled by setting the flag to `false` and
restarting the component. No other changes should be necessary to disable the
feature.

NOTE: Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
-->

Yes, disable is supported.

For `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay`, if this is disabled, once kubelet is
restarted it will initialize the default backoff to the prior initial value of
10s, and all restart delays thereafter will be calculated against this equation.
Since changing this configuration will at minimum require a restart of kubelet
to take effect, restart delays will begin at the beginning of their backoff
curve since the backoff is not cached between kubelet restarts.

For `EnableKubeletCrashLoopBackoffMax`, similarly, if this is disabled, once
kubelet is restarted it will initialize the default backoff based on the global
default -- which will itself depend on whether
`ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay` is independently turned on or not. For a
complete workup of the various conflicts possible and how they will be handled,
see the [Conflict Resolution](#conflict-resolution) section in Design Details.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

Both features can also be reenabled.

For `ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay`, if this is reenabled, once kubelet is
restarted it will initialize the default backoff again to the new initial value
of 1s and maximum backoff to 1 minute, and all restart delays thereafter will be
calculated against this equation.

For `EnableRapidCrashLoopBackoffDecay`, if this is disabled, once kubelet is
restarted it will -- again, as above -- initialize the default backoff based on
the global default -- which will itself depend on whether
`ReduceDefaultCrashLoopBackoffDecay` is independently turned on or not. For a
complete workup of the various conflicts possible and how they will be handled,
see the [Conflict Resolution](#conflict-resolution) section in Design Details..

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282
-->

At minimum, unit tests will be included confirming the backoff object is set
properly depending on the feature gates set as per the [Conflict
Resolution](#conflict-resolution) policy.

In this version of the proposal, there are no API schema changes or conversions
necessary. However it is worth nothing tere is one addition to an API object,
which is a new field in the `KubeletConfiguration` Kind. Based on manual tests
by the author, adding an unknown field to `KubeletConfiguration` is safe and the
unknown config field is dropped before addition to the
`kube-system/kubelet-config` object which is its final destination (for example,
in the case of n-3 kubelets facing a configuration introduced by this KEP). Ultimately this is supported by the configuratinon of a given Kind's `fieldValidation` strategy in API machinery ([ref](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go#L584)) which, in 1.31+, is set to "warn" by default and is only valid for API objects and it turns out is not explicitly set as `strict` for `KuberntesConfiguration` object so they ultimately bypass this ([ref](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/issues/1663#issuecomment-2392453716)). This
is not currently tested as far as I can tell in the tests for
`KubeletConfiguration` (in either the most likely location, in
[validation_test](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/apis/config/validation/validation_test.go),
nor other tests in the [config
package](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/005f184ab631e52195ed6d129969ff3914d51c98/pkg/kubelet/apis/config))
and discussions with other contributors indicate that while little in core
kubernetes does strict parsing, it's not well tested. At minimum as part of this
implementation a test covering this for `KubeletConfiguration` objects will be
included in the `config.validation_test` package.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

<<[UNRESOLVED beta]>> Fill out when targeting beta to a release. <<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

This biggest bottleneck expected will be kubelet, as it is expected to get more
restart requests and have to trigger all the overhead discussed in [Design
Details](#kubelet-overhead-analysis) more often. Cluster operators should be
closely watching these existing metrics:

* Kubelet component CPU and memory
* `kubelet_http_inflight_requests`
* `kubelet_http_requests_duration_seconds`
* `kubelet_http_requests_total`
* `kubelet_pod_worker_duration_seconds`
* `kubelet_runtime_operations_duration_seconds`

Most important to the perception of the end user is Kubelet's actual ability to
create pods, which we measure in the latency of a pod actually starting compared
to its creation timestamp. The following existing metrics are for all pods, not
just ones that are restarting, but at a certain saturation of restarting pods
this metric would be expected to become slower and must be watched to determine
rollback:
* `kubelet_pod_start_duration_seconds`
* `kubelet_pod_start_sli_duration_seconds`


###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

<<[UNRESOLVED beta]>> Fill out when targeting beta to a release. <<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

<<[UNRESOLVED beta]>> Fill out when targeting beta to a release. <<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

<<[UNRESOLVED beta]>> Fill out when targeting beta to a release. <<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

It will not result in NEW API calls but it will result in MORE API calls. See
the [Risks and Mitigations](#risks-and-mitigations) section for the
back-of-the-napkin math on the increase in especially /pods API endpoint calls,
which initial benchmarking showed an aggressive case (110 instantly restarting
single-contaier pods) reaching 5 QPS before slowing down to 2 QPS.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

No, this KEP will not result in any new API types.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

No, this KEP will not result in any new calls to the cloud provider.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

No, this KEP will not result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

Maybe! As containers will be restarting more, this may affect "Startup latency
of schedulable stateless pods", "Startup latency of schedule stateful pods".
This is directly the type of SLI impact that a) the split between the default
behavior change and the per node opt in is trying to mitigate, and b) one of the
targets of the benchmarking period during alpha.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

Yes! We expect more CPU usage of kubelet as it processes more restarts. In
initial manual benchmarking tests, CPU usage of kubelet increased 2x on nodes
saturated with 110 instantly crashing single-container pods. During the alpha
benchmarking period, we will be quantifying that amount in fully and partially
saturated nodes with both the new default backoff curve and the minimum per node
backoff curve.

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

Based on the initial benchmarking, no, which was based on manual benchmarking
tests on nodes saturated with 110 instantly crashing single-container pods.
However, more "normal" cases (with lower percentage of crashing pods) and even
more pathological cases (with higher container-density Pods, sidecars, n/w
traffic, and large image downloads) will be tested further during this alpha
period to better articulate the risk against the most aggressive restart
characteristics.

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider

details). For now, we leave it here.

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

CrashLoopBackoff behavior has been stable and untouched for most of the
Kubernetes lifetime. It could be argued that it "isn't broken", that most people
are ok with it or have sufficient and architecturally well placed workarounds
using third party reaper processes or application code based solutions, and
changing it just invites high risk to the platform as a whole instead of
individual end user deployments. However, per the [Motivation](#motivation)
section, there are emerging workload use cases and a long history of a vocal
minority in favor of changes to this behavior, so trying to change it now is
timely. Obviously we could still decide not to graduate the change out of alpha
if the risks are determined to be too high or the feedback is not positive.

Though the issue is highly upvoted, on an analysis of the comments presented in
the canonical tracking issue
[Kubernetes#57291](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57291), 22
unique commenters were requesting a constant or instant backoff for `Succeeded`
Pods, 19 for earlier recovery tries, and 6 for better late recovery behavior;
the latter is arguably even more highly requested when also considering related
issue [Kubernetes#50375](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/50375).
Though an early version of this KEP also addressed the `Success` case, in its
current version this KEP really only addresses the early recovery case, which by
our quantitative data is actually the least requested option. That being said,
other use cases described in [User Stories](#user-stories) that don't have
quantitative counts are also driving forces on why we should address the early
recovery cases now. On top of that, compared to the late recovery cases, early
recovery is more approachable and easily modelable and improving benchmarking
and insight can help us improve late recovery later on (see also the related
discussion in Alternatives [here](#more-complex-heuristics) and
[here](#late-recovery)).

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

### Global override

Allow an override of the global constant of a maximum backoff period (or other
settings) in kubelet configuration.

### Per exit code configuration

One alternative is for new container spec values that allow individual containers to
respect overrides on the global timeout behavior depending on the exit reason.
These overrides will exist for the following reasons:

* image download failures
* workload crash: any non-0 exit code from the workload itself
* infrastructure events: terminated by the system, e.g. exec probe failures,
  OOMKill, or other kubelet runtime errors
* success: a 0 exit code from the workload itself

These had been selected because there are known use cases where changed restart
behavior would benefit workloads epxeriencing these categories of failures.

### `RestartPolicy: Rapid`

In the 1.31 version of this proposal, this KEP proposed a two-pronged approach
to revisiting the CrashLoopBackoff behaviors for common use cases:
1. modifying the standard backoff delay to start faster but decay to the same 5m
   threshold
2. allowing Pods to opt-in to an even faster backoff curve with a lower max cap

For step (2), the method to allow the Pods to opt-in was by a new enum value,
`Rapid`, for a Pod's `RestartPolicy`. In this case, Pods and restartable init
(aka sidecar) containers would be able to set a new OneOf value, `restartPolicy:
Rapid`, to opt in to an exponential backoff decay that starts at a lower initial
value and maximizes to a lower cap. This proposal suggested we start with a new
initial value of 250ms and cap of 1 minute, and analyze its impact on
infrastructure during alpha.

!["A graph showing today's decay curve against a curve with an initial value of
250ms and a cap of 1 minute for a workload failing every 10 s"](todayvsrapid.png
"rapid vs todays' CrashLoopBackoff")

**Why not?**: There was still a general community consensus that even though
this was opt-in, giving the power to reduce the backoff curve to users in
control of the pod manifest -- who as a persona are not necessarily users with
cluster-wide or at least node-wide visibility into load and scheduling -- was
too risky to global node stability. 

In addition, overriding an existing Pod spec
enum value, while convenient, required detailed management of the version skew
period, at minimum across 3 kubelet versions per the [API policy for new enum values in existing fields](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#new-enum-value-in-existing-field). In practice
this meant the API server and kubelets across all nodes must be coordinated.

Firstly, `Rapid` must be a valid option to the `restartPolicy` in the API server
(which would only be possible if/when the API server was updated), and secondly,
the `Rapid` value must be interpretable by all kubelets on every node.
Unfortunately, it is not possible for the API server to be aware of what version
each kubelet is on, so it cannot serve `Rapid` as `Always` preferentially to
each kubelet depending on its version. Instead, each kubelet must be able to
handle this value properly, both at n-3 kubelet version and -- more easily -- at
its contemporary kubelet version. For updated kubelet versions, each kubelet
would be able to detect if it has the feature gate on, and if so, interpret
`Rapid` to use the new rapid backoff curve; and if the feature gate is off,
interpret it instead as `Always`. But at earlier kubelet versions, `Rapid` must
be ignored in favor of `Always`. Unfortunately for this KEP, the default value
for `restartPolicy` is Never, though even more unfortunately, it looks like
different code paths use a different default value (thank you

[1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a7ca13ea29ba5b3c91fd293cdbaec8fb5b30cee2/pkg/kubelet/container/helpers.go#L105)
defaults to `Always`,
[2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/a7ca13ea29ba5b3c91fd293cdbaec8fb5b30cee2/pkg/kubelet/kubelet_pods.go#L1713)
defaults to `OnFailure`,

defaults to `Always`, and

defaults to `Never`), so if kubelet drops unexpected enum values for
`restartPolicy`, a Pod with `Rapid` will be misconfigured by an old kubelet.

### Flat-rate restarts for `Succeeded` Pods

We start from the assumption that the "Succeeded" phase of a Pod in Kubernetes
means that all workloads completed as expected. Most often this is colloquially
referred to as an exit code 0, as this exit code is what is caught by Kuerbenetes
for linux containers.

The wording of the public documentation
([ref](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-restarts))
and the naming of the `CrashLoopBackOff` state itself implies that it is a
remedy for a container not exiting as intended, but the restart delay decay
curve is applied to even successful pods if their `restartPolicy = Always`. On the
canonical tracking issue for this problem, a significant number of requests
focus on how an exponential decay curve is inappropriate for workloads
completing as expected, and unnecessarily delays healthy workloads from being
rescheduled.

This alternative would vastly simplify and cut down on the restart delays for
workloads completing as expected, as detectable by their transition through the
"Succeeded" phase in Kubernetes. The target is to get as close to the capacity
of kubelet to instantly restart as possible, anticipated to be somewhere within
0-10s flat rate + jitter delay for each restart, pending benchmarking in alpha.

Fundamentally, this change is taking a stand that a successful exit of a
workload is intentional by the end user -- and by extension, if it has been
configured with `restartPolicy = Always`, that its impact on the Kubernetes
infrastructure when restarting is by end user design. This is in contrast to the
prevailing Kubernetes assumption that that on its own, the Pod API best models
long-running containers that rarely or never exit themselves with "Success";
features like autoscaling, rolling updates, and enhanced workload types like
StatefulSets assume this, while other workload types like those implemented with
the Job and CronJob API better model workloads that do exit themselves, running
until Success or at predictable intervals. If this alternative was pursued, we
would instead interpret an end user's choice to run a relatively fast exiting
Pod (under 10 minutes) with both a successful exit code and configured to
`restartPolicy: Always`, as their intention to restart the pod indefinitely
without penalty.

!["A graph comparing today's CrashLoopBackOff decay curve with a linear 5s delay for a container that exits successfully every 10s"](flatratesuccessvstoday.png "linear vs today's CrashLoopBackoff")

**Why not?**: This provides a workaround (and therefore, opportunity for abuse),
where application developers could catch any number of internal errors of their
workload in their application code, but exit successfully, forcing extra fast
restart behavior in a way that is opaque to kubelet or the cluster operator.
Something similar is already being taken advantage of by application developers
via wrapper scripts, but this causes no extra strain on kubelet as it simply
causes the container to run indefinitely and uses no kubelet overhead for
restarts.

#### On Success and the 10 minute recovery threshold

The original version of this proposal included a change specific to Pods
transitioning through the "Succeeded" phase to have flat rate restarts. On
further discussion, this was determined to be both too risky and a non-goal for
Kubernetes architecturally, and moved into the Alternatives section. The risk
for bad actors overloading the kubelet is described in the Alternatives section
and is somewhat obvious. The larger point of it being a non-goal within the
design framework of Kubernetes as a whole is less transparent and discussed
here.

After discussion with early Kubernetes contributors and members of SIG-Node,
it's become more clear to the author that the prevailing Kubernetes assumption
is that that on its own, the Pod API best models long-running containers that
rarely or never exit themselves with "Success"; features like autoscaling,
rolling updates, and enhanced workload types like StatefulSets assume this,
while other workload types like those implemented with the Job and CronJob API
better model workloads that do exit themselves, running until Success or at
predictable intervals. In line with this assumption, Pods that run "for a while"
(longer than 10 minutes) are the ones that are "rewarded" with a reset backoff
counter -- not Pods that exit with Success. Ultimately, non-Job Pods are not
intended to exit Successfully in any meaningful way to the infrastructure, and
quick rerun behavior of any application code is considered to be an application
level concern instead.

Therefore, even though it is widely desired by commenters on
[Kubernetes#57291](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57291), this
KEP is not pursuing a different backoff curve for Pods exiting with Success any
longer.

For Pods that are today intended to rerun after Success, it is instead suggested
to 

1. exec the application logic with an init script or shell that reruns it
   indefinitely, like that described in
   [Kubernetes#57291#issuecomment-377505620](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57291#issuecomment-377505620):
  ```
  #!/bin/bash

  while true; do
      python /code/app.py
  done
  ```
2. or, if a shell in particular is not desired, implement the application such
   that it starts and monitors the restarting process inline, or as a
   subprocess/separate thread/routine

The author is aware that these solutions still do not address use cases where
users have taken advantage of the "cleaner" state "guarantees" of a restarted
pod to alleviate security or privacy concerns between sequenced Pod runs.

This decision here does not disallow the possibility that this is solved in
other ways, for example:
1. the Job API, which better models applications with meaningful Success states,
   introducing a variant that models fast-restarting apps by infrastructure
   configuration instead of by their code, i.e. Jobs with `restartPolicy:
   Always` and/or with no completion count target
2. support restart on exit 0 as a directive in the container runtime or as a
   common independent tool, e.g. `RESTARTABLE CMD mycommand` or
   `restart-on-exit-0 -- mycommand -arg -arg -arg`
3. formalized reaper behavior such as discussed in
   [Kubernetes#50375](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/50375)

However, there will always need to be some throttling or quota for restarts to
protect node stability, so even if these alternatives are pursued separately,
they will depend on the analysis and benchmarking implementation during this
KEP's alpha stage to stay within node stability boundaries. 


##### Related: API opt-in for flat rate/quick restarts when transitioning from `Succeeded` phase

Workloads must opt-in with `restartPolicy: FastOnSuccess`, as a
foil to `restartPolicy: OnFailure`. In this case, existing workloads with
`restartPolicy: Always` or ones not determined to be in the critical path would
use the new, yet still relatively slower, front-loaded decay curve and only
those updated with `FastOnSuccess` would get truer fast restart behavior.
However, then it becomes impossible for a workload to opt into both
`restartPolicy: FastOnSuccess` and `restartPolicy: Rapid`.

##### Related: `Succeeded` vs `Rapid`ly failing: who's getting the better deal?

When both a flat rate `Succeeded` and a `Rapid` implementation were combined in
this proposal, depending on the variation of the initial value, the first few
restarts of a failed container would be faster than a successful container,
which at first look seems backwards.

!["A graph showing the intersection of delay curves between a linear rate for
success and an exponential rate for rapid
failures"](successvsrapidwhenfailed.png "success vs rapid CrashLoopBackoff
dcay")

However, based on the use cases, this is still correct because the goal of
restarting failed containers is to take maximum advantage of quickly recoverable
situations, while the goal of restarting successful containers is only to get
them to run again sometime and not penalize them with longer waits later when
they've behaving as expected.

### Exposing per-node config as command-line flags

Command-line configuration is more easily and transparently exposed in tooling
used to bootstrap nodes via templating. Exposed command-line configuration for
Kubelet are defined by [`struct
KubeletFlags`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/cmd/kubelet/app/options/options.go#L54)
and merged with configuration files in [`kubelet/server.go
NewKubeletCommand`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/cmd/kubelet/app/server.go#L141).
To expose configuration as a command-line flag, a new field would be added to
the `KubeletFlags` struct to be validated in kubelet at runtime.

**Why not?**: Per comments in the code at [this
location](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.31/cmd/kubelet/app/options/options.go#L52),
it seems we don't want to continue to expose configuration at this location. In
addition, since config directories for kubelet config are now in beta
([ref](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/)),
there is a reasonable alternative to per-node configuration using the
`KubeletConfiguration` API object instead. By using the API, we can take
advantage of API machinery level lifecycle, validation and guarantees, including
that unrecognized fields will be dropped in older versions of kubelet, which is
valuable for version skew requirements we must meet back to kubelet n-3. 

### Front loaded decay with interval
In an effort
to anticipate API server stability ahead of the experiential data we can collect
during alpha, the proposed changes are to both reduce the initial value, and include a
step function to a higher delay cap once the decay curve triggers the same
number of total restarts as experienced today in a 10 minute time horizon, in
order to approximate load (though not rate) of pod restart API server requests.

In short, the current proposal is to implement a new initial
value of 1s, and a catch-up delay of 569 seconds (almost 9.5 minutes) on the 6th
retry.

!["A graph showing the delay interval function needed to maintain restart
number"](controlfornumberofrestarts.png
"Alternate CrashLoopBackoff decay")

**Why not?**: If we keep the same decay rate as today (2x), no matter what the
initial value is, the majority of the added restarts are in the beginning. Even
if we "catch up" the delay to the total number of restarts, we expect problem
with kubelet to happen more as a result of the faster restarts in the beginning,
not because we spaced out later ones longer. In addition, we are only talking
about 3-7 more restarts per backoff, even in the fastest modeled case (25ms
initial value), which is not anticipated to be a sufficient enough hit to the
infrastructure to warrant implementing such a contrived backoff curve.

!["A graph showing the changes to restarts depending on some initial values"](initialvaluesandnumberofrestarts.png "Different CrashLoopBackoff initial values")

### Late recovery

There are many use cases not covered in this KEP's target [User
Stories](#user-stories) that share the common properties of being concerned with
the recovery timeline of Pods that have already reached their max cap for their
backoff. Today, some of these Pods will have their backoff counters reset once
they have run successfully for 10 minutes. However, user stories exist where

1. the Pod will never successfully run for 10 minutes by design
2. the user wants to be able to force the decay curve to restart
   ([Kubernetes#50375](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/50375))
3. the application knows what to wait for and could communicate that to the
   system (like a restart probe)

As discussed
[here in Alternatives Considered](#on-success-and-the-10-minute-recovery-threshold),
the first case is unlikely to be address by Kubernetes.

The latter two are considered out of scope for this KEP, as the most common use
cases are regarding the initial recovery period. If there is still sufficient
appetite after this KEP reaches beta to specifically address late recovery
scenarios, then that would be a good time to address them without the noise and
change of this KEP.

### More complex heuristics

The following alternatives are all considered by the author to be in the
category of "more complex heuristics", meaning solutions predicated on kubelet
making runtime decisions on a variety of system or workload states or trends.
These approaches all share the common negatives of being:
1. harder to reason about
2. of unknown return on investment for use cases relative to the investment to
   implement
3. expensive to benchmark and test

That being said, after this initial KEP reaches beta and beyond, it is entirely
possible that the community will desire more sophisticated behavior based on or
inspired by some of these considered alternatives. As mentioned above, the
observability and benchmarking work done within the scope of this KEP can help
users provide empirical support for further enhancements, and the following
review may be useful to such efforts in the future.

  * Expose podFailurePolicy to nonJob Pods
  * Subsidize successful running time/readinessProbe/livenessProbe seconds in
    current backoff delay
  * Detect anomalous workload crashes
