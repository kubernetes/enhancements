## Summary

Kubernetes sometimes returns extremely large responses to clients outside of its local network,
resulting in long delays for components that integrate with the cluster in the list/watch controller
pattern. Kubernetes should properly support transparent gzip response encoding, while ensuring that the
performance of the cluster does not regress for small requests.

## Motivation

In large Kubernetes clusters the size of protobuf or JSON responses may exceed hundreds of
megabytes, and clients that are not on fast local networks or colocated with the master may
experience bandwidth and/or latency issues attempting to synchronize their state with the
server (in the case of custom controllers). Many HTTP servers and clients support transparent
compression by use of the `Accept-Encoding` header, and support for gzip can reduce total
bandwidth requirements for integrating with Kubernetes clusters for JSON by up to 10x and for
protobuf up to 8x.

### Goals

Allow standard HTTP transparent `Accept-Encoding: gzip` behavior to work for large Kubernetes
API requests, without impacting existing Go language clients (which are already sending that header)
or causing a performance regression on the Kubernetes apiservers due to the additional CPU necessary
to compress small requests.

### Non-Goals

* Support other compression formats like Snappy due to limited client support
* Compress non-API responses
* Compress watch responses

## Proposal

### 1.16

* Update the existing incomplete alpha API compression to:
  * Only occur on API requests
  * Only occur on very large responses (>128KB)
* Promote to beta and enable by default since this is a standard feature of HTTP servers
  * Test at large scale to mitigate risk of regression, tune as necessary

### Beta improvements

An [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112296) was opened to revisit the response compression by @shyamjvs (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rMlYKOVyujboAEG2epxSYdx7eyevC7dypkD_kUlBxn4/edit?tab=t.0) which resulted in a few updates.

### 1.25

- [Add flag to disable compression for local traffic](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111507)

### 1.26

- [Reduce default gzip compression level from 4 to 1 in apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112299)
- [Add a "DisableCompression" option to kubeconfig](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112309)
- [Add --disable-compression flag to kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112580)

### Risks and Mitigations

The primary risk is that an operator running Kubernetes very close to the latency and tolerance limits
on a very large and overloaded Kubernetes apiserver who runs an unusually high percentage of large
LIST queries on high bandwidth networks would experience higher CPU use that causes them to hit a CPU
limit. In practice, the cost of gzip proportional to the memory and CPU costs of Go memory allocation
on very large serialization and deserialization grows sublinear, so we judge this unlikely. However,
to give administrators an opportunity to react, we would preserve the feature gate and allow it to be
disabled until 1.17.

Some clients may be requesting gzip and not be correctly handling gzipped responses. An effort should
be made to educate client authors that this change is coming, but in general we do not consider
incorrect client implementations to block implementation of standard HTTP features. The easy mitigation
for many clients is to disable sending `Accept-Encoding` (Go is unusual in providing automatic
transparent compression in the client ecosystem - many client libraries still require opt-in behavior).

## Design Details

Kubernetes has had an alpha implementation of transparent gzip encoding since 1.7. However, this
implementation was never graduated because it caused client misbehavior and the issues were not resolved.

After reviewing the code, the problems in the prior implementation were that it attempted to globally
provide transparent compression as an HTTP middleware component at a much higher level than was necessary.
The bugs that prevented enablement involved double compression of nested responses and failures to
correctly handle flushing of lower level primitives. We do not need to GZIP compress all HTTP endpoints
served by the Kubernetes API server (such as watch requests, exec requests, OpenAPI endpoints which provide
their own compression). Our implementation may satisfy its goals of reducing latency for large requests if
we narrowly scope compression to only those endpoints that need compression.

A further complexity is that the standard Go client library (which Kubernetes has leveraged since 1.0)
always requests compression. Performance testing showed that enabling compression for all suitable
API responses (objects returned via GET, LIST, UPDATE, PATCH) caused a significant performance regression
in both CPU usage (2x) and tail latency (2-5x) on the Kubernetes apiservers. This is due to the additional
CPU costs for performing compression, which impacts tail latency of small requests due to increased
apiserver load. Since forcing all clients in the ecosystem to disable transparent compression by default
is impractical and cannot be done in a gradual manner, we need to apply a more suitable heuristic than
"did the client request transparent compression". According to the HTTP spec, a server may ignore an
`Accept-Encoding` header for any reason, which means we decide *when* we want to compress, not just
whether we compress.

The preferred approach is to only compress responses returned by the API server when encoding objects
that are large enough for compression to benefit the client but not unduly burden the server. In general,
the target of this optimization is extremely large LIST responses which are usually multiple megabytes
in size. These requests are infrequent (<1% of all reads) and when network bandwidth is lower than typical
datacenter speeds (1 GBps) the benefit in reduced latency for clients outweighs the slightly higher CPU
cost for compression.

We experimentally determined a size cut-off for compression that caused no regression on the Kubernetes
density and load tests in either 99th percentile latency or kube-apiserver CPU usage of 128KB, which is
roughly the size of 50 average pods (2.2kb from a large Kubernetes cluster with a diverse workload). This
implementation applies this specific heuristic to the place in the Kubernetes code path where we encode
the body of a response from a single input `[]byte` buffer due to how Kubernetes encodes and manages
responses, which removes the side-effects and unanticipated complexity in the prior implementation.

Given that this is standard HTTP server behavior and can easily be tested with unit, integration, and
our complete end-to-end test suite (due to all of our clients already requesting gzip compression),
there is minimal risk in rolling this out directly to GA. We suggest preserving the feature gate so that
an operator can disable this behavior if they experience a regression in highly-tuned large-scale deployments.

### Test Plan

[X] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit

This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->

- `k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/handlers/responsewriters`: `2025-08-23` - `68.9%`

##### Integration tests

<!--
Integration tests are contained in https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration.
Integration tests allow control of the configuration parameters used to start the binaries under test.
This is different from e2e tests which do not allow configuration of parameters.
Doing this allows testing non-default options and multiple different and potentially conflicting command line options.
For more details, see https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing-strategy.md

If integration tests are not necessary or useful, explain why.
-->

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, document that tests have been written,
have been executed regularly, and have been stable.
This can be done with:
- permalinks to the GitHub source code
- links to the periodic job (typically https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#integration-master), filtered by the test name
- a search in the Kubernetes bug triage tool (https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html)
-->

- [test name](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2334b8469e1983c525c0c6382125710093a25883/test/integration/...): [integration master](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#integration-master?include-filter-by-regex=MyCoolFeature), [triage search](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html?test=MyCoolFeature)

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, document that tests have been written,

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
If e2e tests are not necessary or useful, explain why.
-->

- [test name](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2334b8469e1983c525c0c6382125710093a25883/test/e2e/...): [SIG ...](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-...?include-filter-by-regex=MyCoolFeature), [triage search](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html?test=MyCoolFeature)

### Graduation Criteria

Transparent compression must be implemented in the more focused fashion described in this KEP. The
scalability sig must sign off that the chosen limit (128KB) does not cause a regression in 5000 node
clusters, which may cause us to revise the limit up.


<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, [feature gate] graduations, or as
something else. The KEP should keep this high-level with a focus on what
signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- Initial e2e tests completed and enabled

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- All functionality completed
- All security enforcement completed
- All monitoring requirements completed
- All testing requirements completed
- All known pre-release issues and gaps resolved 

**Note:** Beta criteria must include all functional, security, monitoring, and testing requirements along with resolving all issues and gaps identified

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- Allowing time for feedback
- All issues and gaps identified as feedback during beta are resolved

**Note:** GA criteria must not include any functional, security, monitoring, or testing requirements.  Those must be beta requirements.

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

<!--
- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

N/A - this feature has been in beta, default to on, since 1.16

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and nodes?
- How does an n-3 kubelet or kube-proxy without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- How does an n-1 kube-controller-manager or kube-scheduler without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

N/A - this feature has been in beta, default to on, since 1.16

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [X] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane? No
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node? No

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes, the user can avoid sending requests with `Accept-Encoding` header.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

APIServer can start gzip compressing again.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.

Additionally, for features that are introducing a new API field, unit tests that
are exercising the `switch` of feature gate itself (what happens if I disable a
feature gate after having objects written with the new field) are also critical.
You can take a look at one potential example of such test in:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97058/files#diff-7826f7adbc1996a05ab52e3f5f02429e94b68ce6bce0dc534d1be636154fded3R246-R282
-->

No

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

N/A

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

High CPU usage in APIServer, however, feature has been in beta (default to on) since 1.16

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

Yes

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

No

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

If a client is using a `Accept-Encoding` header with gzip compression


###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [X] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details: If a user adds `Accept-Encoding: gzip` to their request and get a gzipped response back, the feature is working

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

No

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

Yes, latancy can change when using this feature

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md

Yes, CPU can be used to compress API responses

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

No

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

This feature doesn't react any differently than before this feature was introduced.

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

N/A

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

* Kubernetes 1.8 added alpha implementation behind disabled flag
* Kubernetes 1.16 introduces more scope for beta implementation that addresses prior issues

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
