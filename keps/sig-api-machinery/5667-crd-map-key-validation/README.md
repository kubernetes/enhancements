milestone **before the [Enhancement Freeze](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/releases)
of the targeted release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core
Kubernetes—i.e., [kubernetes/kubernetes], we require the following Release
Signoff checklist to be completed.

## Summary

We propose adding a `x-kubernetes-property-names` extension to OpenAPI 3.0.

This extension can be used to validate map keys. For example, to define map
of string to string where the keys and values have a max length of 32:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  exampleMap:
    type: object
    x-kubernetes-property-names:
      type: string
      maxLength: 32
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
      maxLength: 32
```

## Motivation

OpenAPI 3.0 does not provide a direct way to validate map keys.

OpenAPI 3.1 provides validation using `propertyNames`. But OpenAPI 3.1 is backward
incompatible with OpenAPI 3.0. See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/134684
for details on the backward incompatible changes made.

Since upgrading to OpenAPI 3.1 would be a major effort and would be disruptive to the ecosystem,
this KEP proposed we introduce a subset of `propertyNames` functionality under the
`x-kubernetes-property-names` extension as a way of evolving OpenAPI 3.0 in a direction that is
aligned with OpenAPI 3.1.

### Goals

- Enable structural schema validation of map keys (includes `x-kubernetes-validations` support).
- Use `maxLength` on map keys when calculating CEL estimated cost.

### Non-Goals

- Implement OpenAPI 3.1. Support for 3.1 is a large, disruptive change. We do not know if/when
  this will happen, so continuing to improve OpenAPI 3.0 is pragmatic.

## Proposal

- Add `x-kubernetes-property-names` extension.
- Require the use of structural schemas for map keys.
- Update CEL cost estimate system to use `maxLength` of map keys.

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

User adds a field to a CRD that should contain only valid Kubernetes labels.

Solution:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  labels:
    type: object
    x-kubernetes-property-names:
      type: string
      format: k8s-label-key # A proposed format for label keys
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
      format: k8s-label-value # A proposed format for label values
```

#### Story 2

User introduces a CEL rule that checks map keys, but the CEL estimated cost is too high
if there is no maxLengh limit set on the key field.

Solution:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  labels:
    type: object
    x-kubernetes-property-names:
      type: string
      maxLength: 64
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
```

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

- Map keys MUST be strings. This will be enforced, and only value validations that apply to
  strings will be allowed.
- OpenAPI 3.0 libraries that do not recognize the `x-kubernetes-property-names` property are required to ignore it.
  This is what makes using an extension preferable to using `propertyNames`. OpenAPI 3.0 libraries may report
  an "unrecognized property" error if `propertyNames` is encountered.
- Support for key defaults will also be added.

### Risks and Mitigations

Risk: The ecosystem is fragmented by CRD schemas that use this feature, since older versions of Kubernetes
do not support it.

Mitigation: Ratchet it in. We do this for other capabilities like new formats, CEL functions, ...

## Design Details

- Supporting structural schemas makes it easier to reason about what capabilities are available.
- Defaults WILL be supported.

### Test Plan

- Add CRD validation tests to test that x-kubernetes-property-names works as expected
- Add CR validation tests covering the new map key validation capabilities
- Add CEL estimated cost tests to ensure estimated costs account for a map key with maxLength

##### Prerequisite testing updates

<!--
Based on reviewers feedback describe what additional tests need to be added prior
implementing this enhancement to ensure the enhancements have also solid foundations.
-->

##### Unit tests

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

##### Integration tests

- [test name](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2334b8469e1983c525c0c6382125710093a25883/test/integration/...): [integration master](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#integration-master?include-filter-by-regex=MyCoolFeature), [triage search](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html?test=MyCoolFeature)

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.

For Beta and GA, document that tests have been written,
have been executed regularly, and have been stable.
This can be done with:
- permalinks to the GitHub source code
- links to the periodic job (typically a job owned by the SIG responsible for the feature), filtered by the test name
- a search in the Kubernetes bug triage tool (https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html)

We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.
If e2e tests are not necessary or useful, explain why.
-->

- [test name](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2334b8469e1983c525c0c6382125710093a25883/test/e2e/...): [SIG ...](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-...?include-filter-by-regex=MyCoolFeature), [triage search](https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html?test=MyCoolFeature)

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha

- Feature implemented behind a feature flag
- All unit, integration and e2e tests completed and enabled

<!--

#### Beta

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Additional tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- All functionality completed
- All security enforcement completed
- All monitoring requirements completed
- All testing requirements completed
- All known pre-release issues and gaps resolved

**Note:** Beta criteria must include all functional, security, monitoring, and testing requirements along with resolving all issues and gaps identified

#### GA

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- Allowing time for feedback
- All issues and gaps identified as feedback during beta are resolved

**Note:** GA criteria must not include any functional, security, monitoring, or testing requirements.  Those must be beta requirements.

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

#### Deprecation

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

During upgrades, apiservers start accepting the new extension field and will start enforcing it.

During upgrades, apiservers will stop accepting the new extension field and will stop enforcing it.
The field will also be dropped from read requests.

### Version Skew Strategy

apiserver versions with the feature enabled will enforce validation while apiserver versions
without the feature will not enforce validation, but will be able to safely read it from storage
and ignore it.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.
-->

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release.
-->

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

<!--
Pick one of these and delete the rest.

Documentation is available on [feature gate lifecycle] and expectations, as
well as the [existing list] of feature gates.

[feature gate lifecycle]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[existing list]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/
-->

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name: CRDPropertyNameSchemas
  - Components depending on the feature gate: kube-apiserver
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node?

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The validation is reactivated.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Yes, there will be integration tests for this.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

<!--
Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
mid-rollout?

Be sure to consider highly-available clusters, where, for example,
feature flags will be enabled on some API servers and not others during the
rollout. Similarly, consider large clusters and how enablement/disablement
will rollout across nodes.
-->

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

<!--
What signals should users be paying attention to when the feature is young
that might indicate a serious problem?
-->

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

<!--
Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.
-->

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

###### Can enabling / using this feature result in resource exhaustion of some node resources (PIDs, sockets, inodes, etc.)?

<!--
Focus not just on happy cases, but primarily on more pathological cases
(e.g. probes taking a minute instead of milliseconds, failed pods consuming resources, etc.).
If any of the resources can be exhausted, how this is mitigated with the existing limits
(e.g. pods per node) or new limits added by this KEP?

Are there any tests that were run/should be run to understand performance characteristics better
and validate the declared limits?
-->

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->
