## Summary
- https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/d5b2a0438dc685db5222a66291d6100745a58101/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/tools/record/event.go#L93
The current EventRecorder interface only abstracts the interface for setting annotations, but does not abstract the interface for setting labels.



## Motivation

Our scenario is similar to the spanid and traceid in distributed tracing.
This way, a batch of events can be selected through the label, and then grouped.

### Goals

- Supports setting the label when creating an event

### Non-Goals

## Proposal

- Add a new function abstraction to the EventRecorder interface
 ```LabeledAnnotatedEventf(object runtime.Object, labels, annotations map[string]string, eventtype, reason, messageFmt string, args ...interface{}) ```


NOTE: When an external project references this interface, the corresponding implementation needs to add the LabeledAnnotatedEventf function.


### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates

##### Unit tests

<!--
In principle every added code should have complete unit test coverage, so providing
the exact set of tests will not bring additional value.
However, if complete unit test coverage is not possible, explain the reason of it
together with explanation why this is acceptable.
-->

<!--
Additionally, for Alpha try to enumerate the core package you will be touching
to implement this enhancement and provide the current unit coverage for those
in the form of:
- <package>: <date> - <current test coverage>
The data can be easily read from:
https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-testing-canaries#ci-kubernetes-coverage-unit
This can inform certain test coverage improvements that we want to do before
extending the production code to implement this enhancement.
-->


##### Integration tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.
For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
-->

##### e2e tests

<!--
This question should be filled when targeting a release.
For Alpha, describe what tests will be added to ensure proper quality of the enhancement.
For Beta and GA, add links to added tests together with links to k8s-triage for those tests:
https://storage.googleapis.com/k8s-triage/index.html
We expect no non-infra related flakes in the last month as a GA graduation criteria.

### Graduation Criteria

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- It does not affect the existing program. Even if the versions are different, it doesn't matter.

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

It only adds new behavior and does not affect other pars of the Kubernetes.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

No.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

When using the new function, a panic will occur.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

Does not require special testing frameworks.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

Enabling the feature does not affect any workloads.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

Specific metrics are not required for the monitoring of this feature.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

<!--
Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.
-->

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?


###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?


###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

No.

### Scalability

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

No.

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

No.

### Troubleshooting

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?


###### What are other known failure modes?


###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

No steps required.

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->
